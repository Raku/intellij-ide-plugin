<h1>Use Ctrl+N to find a type</h1>
<p>
  Pressing <span class="control">Ctrl+N</span> opens the Navigate To
  Type popup. Use this to quickly find and jump to any type (<code>class</code>,
  <code>role</code>, <code>subset</code>, <code>enum</code>, etc.) declared
  within the project.
</p>
<p>
  You only need to type enough to find what you're looking for, and it
  is fine to type a latter part of the type name rather than typing it
  from the start.
