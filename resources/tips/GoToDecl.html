<h1>Use Ctrl+B to jump to a declaration</h1>
<p>
  When your cursor is on various kinds of symbol, pressing
  <span class="control">Ctrl+B</span> will take you to the declaration
  of that symbol.
</p>
<p>
  This works on usages of lexical variables, private methods in the current
  class, subroutines declared within the project (either in the same file
  or imported), and types declared within the project (classes, roles,
  grammars, subsets, and so forth).
