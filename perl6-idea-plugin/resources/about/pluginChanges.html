<h1>Change List</h1>

<h2>2018.11.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Annotate a class that fails to implement stubbed role methods, and provide
        a fix that stubs those methods inside of the class (this is especially handy
        when using roles as an interface, and want to implement it in many classes)</li>
    <li>Annotate use of does trait with a class, and offer a fix to use is trait
        instead</li>
    <li>Annotate use of the export trait on a my-scoped variable as an error, and
        propose to switch to our scope</li>
    <li>Annotate use of monitor without having used OO::Monitors as an error, and
        provide a fix to add that use statement and update META6.json if needed</li>
    <li>Complete methods from Cursor when writing a method in a grammar</li>
    <li>Offer multi methods in auto-complete</li>
    <li>Parse, highlight, and brace-match multiline comments</li>
    <li>Fix a performance regression on reference resolution and auto-complete that
        was particularly noticeable in larger projects</li>
    <li>When completing the rule call syntax, offer methods in the current grammar
        (for example, if a grammar contains a panic method, calling it from a rule
        will now auto-complete and reference resolve)</li>
    <li>Fix Find Usages for a rule in a regex when the cursor is placed on its name</li>
    <li>Fix incorrect error annotation about wrong parameter order when a normal positional
        parameter came after a positional parameter constrained on type only</li>
    <li>When annotating a call to an undeclared private method, only mark the method
        name, not its arguments</li>
    <li>Fix bogus triggering of undeclarable variable error</li>
    <li>Make sure module name field gets focus in the dialog to add a module
        dependency</li>
    <li>Fix incorrect sigspace indication on unquoted literals</li>
    <li>Pass Perl 6 options when running under the debugger</li>
    <li>Fix an exception related to modules resolution which occurred on Windows</li>
</ul>
