<h1>Change List</h1>

<h2>2018.8.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Provide better method auto-completion by accounting for declared types of
        variables and parameters, as well as performing basic type inference on
        literals, various special variables ($/ and $0 are always a Match),
        syntactic constructs producing known types, Foo.new, and initial assignment
        to a variable</li>
    <li>Add auto-completion of rule names when authoring grammars</li>
    <li>Provide Go To Declaration (Ctrl + B) support on grammar rules, to make it
        easier to navigate around grammars</li>
    <li>When auto-completing <code>use</code> and <code>need</code>, suggest ecosystem modules as well as
        pragmas and modules included with Perl 6 (Test and NativeCall)</li>
    <li>Detect dependency on a module whose distribution is not declared in the
        depends section of META6.json, and provide a fix to add the appropriate
        distribution to META6.json (this handles cases where the distribution name
        does not match the module name; for example, use of Cro::HTTP::Client would
        add the Cro::HTTP distribution to the META6.json)</li>
    <li>In Project View, show the dependencies under the External Libraries section</li>
    <li>Detect and mark various incorrect parameter orderings as an error (for
        example, declaration of a required parameter after an optional one)</li>
    <li>Mark declaration of undeclarable variables like $0 as an error</li>
    <li>Mark use of unit sub as an error if the sub is not named MAIN</li>
    <li>Mark use of whenever outside of a supply or react block as an error</li>
    <li>Mark null regex as an error, and add a fix to insert &lt;?&gt;</li>
    <li>Mark use of range with no endpoint as an error, and add a fix to add a * endpoint</li>
    <li>If an EVAL is used with an interpolated variable, and MONKEY or MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL is not
        used, mark it as an error and provide a fix to include MONKEY-SEE-NO-EVAL</li>
    <li>When the cursor is on a range 0..10, offer ^9 as an alternative; do similar for
        0..$n-1 with the fix replacing it with ^$n</li>
    <li>Run tests in subdirectories under t/ and sort the test files</li>
    <li>Fix running of scripts on Windows</li>
    <li>Fix passing of arguments when running a script</li>
    <li>Do not forget Perl 6 parameters in run configurations between restarts</li>
    <li>Fix parsing of a colonpair inside of an array literal</li>
    <li>Implement parsing of parametric role signatures, and support Go To Declaration
        for sigil parameters declared by the role</li>
    <li>Fix mis-parsing of colonpairs with parenthesized values</li>
    <li>Accept whitespace at the end of an argument list</li>
    <li>Fix parser crash with <code>sub foo($c&lt;x&gt;)</code></li>
    <li>Don't wrongly mark EVAL as an undeclared routine</li>
    <li>Correct signature summary for signatures with literal values</li>
    <li>Fix checking for updates to Comma</li>
</ul>
