<h1>Change List</h1>

<h2>2018.7.1</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Add first steps towards method auto-completion, supporting it for method
        calls on <code>self</code> and type objects; includes methods composed from roles and
        inherited from base classes, whether they are internal to the project, in
        the CORE builtins, or from an external module</li>
    <li>Support Go To Definition (Ctrl+B) for method calls within the project that
        are made on <code>self</code> or a type object</li>
    <li>Implement Move Statement support (Ctrl+Shift+Up, Ctrl+Shift+Down), so that
        multi-line statements can be moved</li>
    <li>Correct some cases where a sub call imported from another module within the
        project was wrongly detected as undeclared and failed to Go To Definition</li>
    <li>Fix a bug causing partially missing auto-complete information from external
        modules</li>
    <li>Make the display of test results more incremental, showing them as each file
        completes its run</li>
    <li>Add Project view in the standalone Comma IDE</li>
    <li>Made Project view hide .precomp directories</li>
    <li>Parse and highlight version literals</li>
    <li>Parse and highlight macro and quasi</li>
    <li>Correct whitespace parsing in various places in regexes, so that a
        backslashed comment character is never incorrectly treated as unspace</li>
    <li>Avoid a crash when encountering incorrect JSON in the META6.json file</li>
    <li>Fix a crash that could occur sometimes during project import or creation</li>
    <li>Correct highlighting of a sub or private method call to indicate other calls to the
        same sub to put a background highlight on the name, not on the whole
        argument list</li>
</ul>
