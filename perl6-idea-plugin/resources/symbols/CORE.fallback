In this\ncase we are declaring this new method simply to avoid the extra syntax of\nusing pairs when creating the object. self.bless returns the object, which\nis in turn returned by new.\n\nHowever, in general, implementing a customized new method might not be the\nbest way of initializing a class, even more so if the default constructor\nis disabled, since it can make it harder to correctly initialize the class\nfrom a subclass. For instance, in the above example, the new implementation\ntakes two positional arguments that must be passed from the subclass to the\nsuperclass in the exact order. That is not a real problem if it's\ndocumented, but take into account bless will eventually be calling BUILD in\nthe class that is being instantiated. This might result in some unwanted\nproblems, like having to create a BUILD submethod to serve it correctly:\n\n    class Point {\n        has Int $.x;\n        has Int $.y;\n        multi method new($x, $y) {\n            self.bless(:$x, :$y);\n        }\n    }\n\n    class Point-with-ID is Point {\n        has Int $.ID  is rw = 0;\n\n        submethod BUILD( *%args ) {\n            say %args;                # OUTPUT: «{x => 1, y => 2}␤»\n            for self.^attributes -> $attr {\n                if $attr.Str ~~ /ID/ {\n                    $attr.set_value( self, \"*\" ~ %args<x> ~ \"-\" ~ %args<y> ) ;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    my $p = Point-with-ID.new(1,2);\n    say $p.perl;\n    # OUTPUT: «Point-with-ID.new(ID => \"*1-2\", x => 1, y => 2)␤»\n\n\nIn this code, bless, called within Point.new, is eventually calling BUILD\nwith the same parameters. We have to create a convoluted way of using the\n$.ID attribute using the metaobject protocol so that we can instantiate it\nand thus serve that new constructor, which can be called on Point-with-ID\nsince it is a subclass.\n\nWe might have to use something similar if we want to instantiate\nsuperclasses. bless will help us with that, since it is calling across all\nthe hierarchy:\n\n    class Str-with-ID is Str {\n        my $.counter = 0;\n        has Int $.ID  is rw = 0;\n\n        multi method new( $str ) {\n            self.bless( value => $str, ID => $.counter++ );\n        }\n\n        submethod BUILD( *%args ) {\n            for self.^attributes -> $attr {\n                if $attr.Str ~~ /ID/ {\n                    $attr.set_value( self, %args<ID> ) ;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    say Str-with-ID.new(\"1.1,2e2\").ID;                  # OUTPUT: «0␤»\n    my $enriched-str = Str-with-ID.new(\"3,4\");\n    say \"$enriched-str, {$enriched-str.^name}, {$enriched-str.ID}\";\n    # OUTPUT: «3,4, Str-with-ID, 1␤»\n\n\nWe are enriching Str with an auto-incrementing ID. We create a new since we\nwant to initialize it with a string and, besides, we need to instantiate\nthe superclass. We do so using bless from within new. bless is going to\ncall Str.BUILD. It will *capture* the value it's looking for, the pair\nvalue = $str> and initialize itself. But we have to initialize also the\nproperties of the subclass, which is why within BUILD we use the previously\nexplained method to initialize $.ID with the value that is in the %args\nvariable. As shown in the output, the objects will be correctly initialized\nwith its ID, and will correctly behave as Str, converting themselves in\njust the string in the say statement, and including the ID property as\nrequired.\n\nFor more details see the documentation on object construction.","k":"m","s":{"p":["*%attrinit"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"bless"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["@autovivs","%attrinit","*%_"]},"n":"BUILDALL","m":0,"k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["%attrinit","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"BUILD_LEAST_DERIVED","k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":1,"n":"Numeric"},{"n":"Real","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"n":"Str","m":1,"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m","d":"multi method Str(--> Str)\n\nReturns a string representation of the invocant, intended to be machine\nreadable.

(For immutable sets, see Set instead.)\n\nObjects/values of any type are allowed as set elements. Within a Set, every\nelement is guaranteed to be unique (in the sense that no two elements would\ncompare positively with the === operator):\n\n    my $fruits = <peach apple orange apple apple>.SetHash;\n\n    say $fruits.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    say $fruits.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «apple orange peach␤»\n\n\nSetHashes can be treated as object hashes using the { } postcircumfix\noperator, which returns the value True for keys that are elements of the\nset, and False for keys that aren't. Assigning a value that boolifies to\nTrue or False, respectively, can be used to add or remove a set element:\n\n    my $fruits = <peach apple orange apple apple>.SetHash;\n\n    say $fruits<apple>;     # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $fruits<kiwi>;      # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\n    $fruits<apple kiwi> = False, True;\n    say $fruits.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «kiwi orange peach␤»\n\n\nHere is a convenient shorthand idiom for adding and removing SetHash\nelements:\n\n    my SetHash $fruits .= new;\n    say $fruits<cherry>;      # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    $fruits<cherry>++;\n    say $fruits<cherry>;      # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    $fruits<apple banana kiwi>»++; # Add multiple elements\n\n    $fruits<cherry>--;\n    say $fruits<cherry>;      # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    $fruits<banana kiwi>»--; # Remove multiple elements\n\n\n\nCreating SetHash objects\n\nSetHashes can be composed using SetHash.new. Any positional parameters,\nregardless of their type, become elements of the set:\n\n    my $n = SetHash.new: \"zero\" => 0, \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(:two(2), :zero(0), :one(1)).Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Pair) (Pair) (Pair))␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .SetHash coercer (or its functional form, SetHash()) can\nbe called on an existing object to coerce it to a SetHash. Its semantics\ndepend on the type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the\nobject in list context and creates a set with the resulting items as\nelements, although for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys\nbecome elements of the set - and keys mapped to values which boolify to\nFalse are skipped:\n\n    my $n = (\"zero\" => 0, \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2).SetHash;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(\"one\", \"two\").Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»\n\nIt is also possible to initialize a single key with the use of {}:\n\n    my $sh = SetHash.new;\n    $sh{ 'key1' } = True;\n    $sh{ 'key2' } = 'Hello World!';\n    $sh{ 'key3' } = 0;  # does not store the key since 0.Bool is False\n    say $sh;            # OUTPUT: «SetHash(key1 key2)␤»\n    say $sh.keys.perl;  # OUTPUT: «(\"key1\", \"key2\").Seq␤»\n\nor, in order to initialize more than one key at the same time, use a list\nassignment:\n\n    my $sh = SetHash.new;\n    $sh{ 'a', 'b', 'c' } = True, False, True;\n    say $sh.keys.perl;  # OUTPUT: «(\"a\", \"c\").Seq␤»\n\nYou can also create SetHash masquerading as a hash by using the is trait:\n\n    my %sh is SetHash = <a b c>;\n    say %sh<a>;  # True\n    say %sh<d>;  # False\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) it is also possible to specify the type of\nvalues you would like to allow in a SetHash. This can either be done when\ncalling .new:\n\n    # only allow Pairs\n    my $n = SetHash[Pair].new: \"zero\" => 0, \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2;\n\nor using the masquerading syntax:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my %sh is SetHash[Str] = <a b c>;\n    say %sh<a>;  # True\n    say %sh<d>;  # False\n\n    # only allow whole numbers\n    my %sh is SetHash[Int] = <a b c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\nRaku provides common set operators, which can take SetHashes (or any other\ncollections) as input, although result sets are returned as immutable Sets.\nFor example:\n\n    my ($a, $b) = SetHash.new(1, 2, 3), SetHash.new(2, 4);\n\n    say $a (<) $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (&) $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(2)␤»\n    say $a (^) $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 3, 4)␤»\n    say $a (|) $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 2, 3, 4)␤»\n\n    # Unicode versions:\n    say $a ⊂ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ∩ $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(2)␤»\n    say $a ⊖ $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 3, 4)␤»\n    say $a ∪ $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 2, 3, 4)␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set operators with detailed\nexplanations.\n\nSee Also\n\nSets, Bags, and

They store a reference to the original string\n(.orig), positional and named captures, the positions of the start and end\nof the match in the original string, and a payload referred to as AST\n(abstract syntax tree), which can be used to build data structures from\ncomplex regexes and grammars.\n\nThe last match is also stored in the $¢ Match object, which is lexically\nscoped to the regex, that is, only available from within the regular\nexpression, as shown here:\n\n    my $c;\n    'abc' ~~ /.$${ $c = $¢ }/;\n    say $c; # OUTPUT: «｢c｣␤»\n\nIn this case, we are running the code among curly braces when the match\noccurs, in this case the last letter in the string (actually, the last,\nindicated by the double $, character); $c gets the value of the cursor $¢,\nwhich contains the Match; when used with say, the Match is stringified by\ncalling .Str on it. This $¢ offers a way of capturing the Match inside a\nregular expression; outside, you need to use $/\n\n    my $c; 'camelia' ~~ /<[ l m ]> {$c = $¢}/;\n    say $c; # OUTPUT: «｢m｣␤»\n    say $/; # OUTPUT: «｢m｣␤»\n\nNote: This feature works only from Raku version 2018.02. It would have\nreturned Nil with any previous version. Alternatively and prior to that\nversion, you could use $/ which, inside the regex, has the same value:\n\n    '123' ~~ / (\\d) { say $0; say $/; } \\d+ /; # OUTPUT: «｢1｣␤｢1｣␤ 0 => ｢1｣␤»\n\nThe main difference between $/ and $¢ is scope: the latter only has a value\ninside the regex:\n\n    '123' ~~ / (\\d) { say $/; say $¢; } \\d+ /; # OUTPUT: «｢1｣␤ 0 => ｢1｣␤｢1｣␤ 0 => ｢1｣␤»\n    say \"¢ → \", $¢, \"/ is $/\"; ; # OUTPUT: «¢ → Nil/ is 123␤»\n\n\nSubmatches are also Match objects (or lists of Match objects, if the\ncorresponding regex was quantified), so each match object can be seen as\nthe root of a tree of match objects.\n\nA Match object can also hold the result of a match in progress (while the\ngrammar engine is running), in which case the pos method returns the\ncurrent position. This view on Match objects is only visible if you call\ncode from within a regex.\n\nNote (deprecated): There is a synonym for this class, Cursor, defined as:\n\n    my constant Cursor = Match\n\nInitially, it was used to keep track of initial position in regex matches.\nIn current versions, it's an alias for Match.\n\n","k":"c","b":"C","a":[{"n":"@!list","t":"List","k":"v"},{"n":"%!hash","t":"Hash","k":"v"}],"m":[{"m":0,"n":"ast","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m","d":"Alias for #method made."},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"made","d":"Returns the payload that was set with make.","k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"STR","m":0},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"MATCH"},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"CURSOR_NEXT","m":0},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"CURSOR_OVERLAP","m":0,"k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"CURSOR_MORE","k":"m"},{"m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Callable:D \\var","$","$","$","$","$","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE","s":{"p":["Iterable:D \\var","int \\im","int \\monkey","int \\s","$","\\context","*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["Associative:D \\var","int \\im","$","$","$","\\context","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"INTERPOLATE","m":1},{"k":"m","n":"INTERPOLATE","m":1,"s":{"p":["Regex:D \\var","int \\im","int \\monkey","$","$","$","*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Mu:D \\var","int \\im","int \\monkey","$","$","\\context","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"n":"INTERPOLATE","m":1,"s":{"p":["Mu:U \\var","$","$","$","$","$","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["Associative:D $","$","$","$","$","$","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION","k":"m"},{"k":"m","m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Iterable:D \\var","int \\im","int \\monkey","int \\s","$","\\context","*%_"]}},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Mu:D \\var","int \\im","int \\monkey","$","$","\\context","*%_"]},"m":1,"n":"INTERPOLATE_ASSERTION"},{"s":{"p":["$rule","|c is raw"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"CALL_SUBRULE","m":0,"k":"m"},{"n":"DYNQUANT_LIMITS","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$mm","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"OTHERGRAMMAR","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$grammar","$name","|"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["$name","|c is raw"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"INDMETHOD"},{"s":{"p":["$rule","|c is raw"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"INDRULE","m":0,"k":"m"},{"k":"m","n":"RECURSE","m":0,"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"n":"BUILD","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":[":$orig = \"\"",":$from = 0",":to(:$pos)",":ast(:$made)",":$shared",":$braid",":$list",":$hash","*%_"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    method clone()\n\nClones the Match object.","n":"clone","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"m":1,"n":"Bool","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Bool"},"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    method Bool(Capture:D: --> Bool:D)\n\nReturns True on successful and False on unsuccessful matches.

For example, the December 31, 2016 leap\nsecond was announced in July and shipped with Rakudo 2016.07, so 2016.06\nand earlier releases won't know about it:\n\n    $ perl6-2016.06 -e 'say Instant.from-posix: 1485726595'\n    Instant:1485726631\n\n    $ perl6-2016.07 -e 'say Instant.from-posix: 1485726595'\n    Instant:1485726632\n\n\nSince a Rakudo compiler always returns 0 for future leap seconds it doesn't\nknow about, you can patch your old code when new leap seconds are\nannounced, so it will give correct results, regardless of what version of\nthe compiler it runs on:\n\n    $ perl6-2016.06 -e 'say ($*VM.version before v2016.07 ?? 1 !! 0) + Instant.from-posix: 1485726595'\n    Instant:1485726632\n\n    $ perl6-2016.07 -e 'say ($*VM.version before v2016.07 ?? 1 !! 0) + Instant.from-posix: 1485726595'\n    Instant:1485726632\n\n\n","t":"Instant","k":"c"},{"t":"Sub","k":"v","n":"&ords"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Cool:D $s"]},"m":1,"n":"ords","k":"s"},{"n":"REPL","m":[{"m":0,"n":"new","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Mu \\compiler","Mu \\adverbs","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["Mu \\compiler","$multi-line-enabled","*%_"]},"n":"init","m":0},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"teardown","m":0},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["$code","\\exception","*%adverbs"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"repl-eval"},{"k":"m","n":"interactive_prompt","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"repl-loop","s":{"p":["*%adverbs"],"r":"Mu"}},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Nil"},"m":0,"n":"ctxsave","k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"input-incomplete","s":{"p":["Mu $value","*%_"],"r":"Bool:D"},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"input-toplevel-control","s":{"p":["Mu $value","*%_"],"r":"Bool:D"}},{"n":"repl-print","m":0,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":["Mu $value","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Str:D"},"n":"history-file","m":0,"k":"m"},{"k":"m","n":"compiler","m":0,"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["@auto","%init","*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"BUILDALL"}],"mro":["Completions","Any","Mu"],"a":[{"n":"$.compiler","t":"Mu","k":"v"},{"t":"Bool","k":"v","n":"$!multi-line-enabled"},{"t":"IO::Path","k":"v","n":"$!history-file"},{"t":"Mu","k":"v","n":"$!save_ctx"},{"t":"Mu","k":"v","n":"$!need-more-input"},{"n":"$!control-not-allowed","k":"v","t":"Mu"},{"k":"v","t":"Positional","n":"@!completions"}],"b":"A","k":"c","t":"REPL"},{"t":"Sub","k":"v","n":"&atomic-fetch"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$source is rw"]},"n":"atomic-fetch","m":1},{"n":"atomic-fetch","m":1,"s":{"p":["atomicint $source is rw"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"t":"Sub","k":"v","n":"&infix:<…>"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["|c is raw"]},"n":"infix:<…>","m":1,"k":"s"},{"t":"Sub+{is-pure}","k":"v","n":"&postfix:<ⁿ>"},{"m":1,"n":"postfix:<ⁿ>","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\a","\\b"]},"k":"s"},{"n":"SIGXCPU","t":"Signal","k":"e"},{"t":"Rat","d":"TITLE\nclass Rat\n\nSUBTITLE\nRational number (limited-precision)\n\n    class Rat is Cool does Rational[Int, uint64] { }\n\nRat objects store rational numbers as a pair of a numerator and\ndenominator.

It provides mutual\nexclusion, meaning that only one thread may hold the lock at a time. Once\nthe lock is unlocked, another thread may then lock it.\n\nA Lock is typically used to protect access to one or more pieces of state.\nFor example, in this program:\n\n    my $x = 0;\n    my $l = Lock.new;\n    await (^10).map: {\n        start {\n            $l.protect({ $x++ });\n        }\n    }\n    say $x;         # OUTPUT: «10␤»\n\nThe Lock is used to protect operations on $x. An increment is not an atomic\noperation; without the lock, it would be possible for two threads to both\nread the number 5 and then both store back the number 6, thus losing an\nupdate. With the use of the Lock, only one thread may be running the\nincrement at a time.\n\nA Lock is re-entrant, meaning that a thread that holds the lock can lock it\nagain without blocking. That thread must unlock the same number of times\nbefore the lock can be obtained by another thread (it works by keeping a\nrecursion count).\n\nIt's important to understand that there is no direct connection between a\nLock and any particular piece of data; it is up to the programmer to ensure\nthat the Lock is held during all operations that involve the data in\nquestion. The OO::Monitors module, while not a complete solution to this\nproblem, does provide a way to avoid dealing with the lock explicitly and\nencourage a more structured approach.\n\nThe Lock class is backed by operating-system provided constructs, and so a\nthread that is waiting to acquire a lock is, from the point of view of the\noperating system, blocked.\n\nCode using high-level Raku concurrency constructs should avoid using Lock.\nWaiting to acquire a Lock blocks a real Thread, meaning that the thread\npool (used by numerous higher-level Raku concurrency mechanisms) cannot use\nthat thread in the meantime for anything else.\n\nAny await performed while a Lock is held will behave in a blocking manner;\nthe standard non-blocking behavior of await relies on the code following\nthe `await` resuming on a different Thread from the pool, which is\nincompatible with the requirement that a Lock be unlocked by the same\nthread that locked it. See Lock::Async for an alternative mechanism that\ndoes not have this shortcoming.\n\nBy their nature, Locks are not composable, and it is possible to end up\nwith hangs should circular dependencies on locks occur. Prefer to structure\nconcurrent programs such that they communicate results rather than modify\nshared data structures, using mechanisms like Promise, Channel and Supply.\n\n","m":[{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"new","m":0,"k":"m"},{"d":"Defined as:\n\n    method lock(Lock:D:)\n\nAcquires the lock.

The lock method returns a Promise, which will be kept when the lock\nis available. This Promise can be used with non-blocking await. This means\nthat a thread from the thread pool need not be consumed while waiting for\nthe Lock::Async to be available, and the code trying to obtain the lock\nwill be resumed once it is available.\n\nThe result is that it's quite possible to have many thousands of\noutstanding Lock::Async lock requests, but just a small number of threads\nin the pool. Attempting that with a traditional Lock would not go so well!\n\nThere is no requirement that a Lock::Async is locked and unlocked by the\nsame physical thread, meaning it is possible to do a non-blocking await\nwhile holding the lock. The flip side of this is Lock::Async is not\nre-entrant.\n\nWhile Lock::Async works in terms of higher-level Raku concurrency\nmechanisms, it should be considered a building block.

(For mutable sets, see SetHash instead.)\n\nObjects/values of any type are allowed as set elements. Within a Set, every\nelement is guaranteed to be unique (in the sense that no two elements would\ncompare positively with the === operator):\n\n    my $fruits = set <peach apple orange apple apple>;\n\n    say $fruits.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    say $fruits.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «apple orange peach␤»\n\n\nSets can be treated as object hashes using the { } postcircumfix operator,\nwhich returns the value True for keys that are elements of the set, and\nFalse for keys that aren't:\n\n    my $fruits = set <peach apple orange apple apple>;\n    say $fruits<apple>;  # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $fruits<kiwi>;   # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nCreating Set objects\n\nSets can be composed using the set subroutine (or Set.new, for which it is\na shorthand). Any positional parameters, regardless of their type, become\nelements of the set:\n\n    my $n = set \"zero\" => 0, \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(:two(2), :zero(0), :one(1)).Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Pair) (Pair) (Pair))␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .Set coercer (or its functional form, Set()) can be\ncalled on an existing object to coerce it to a Set. Its semantics depend on\nthe type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the object in\nlist context and creates a set with the resulting items as elements,\nalthough for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys become elements\nof the set - and keys mapped to values which boolify to False are skipped:\n\n    my $n = (\"zero\" => 0, \"one\" => 1, \"two\" => 2).Set;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(\"one\", \"two\").Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»\n\nFurthermore, you can get a Set by using set operators (see next section) on\nobjects of other types such as List, which will act like they internally\ncall .Set on them before performing the operation. Be aware of the tight\nprecedence of those operators though, which may require you to use\nparentheses around arguments:\n\n    say (1..5) (^) 4;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 2, 3, 5)␤»\n\nOf course, you can also create a Set with the .new method.\n\n    my $fruits = Set.new( <peach apple orange apple apple> );\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) you can also use this syntax for\nparameterization of the Set, to specify which type of values are\nacceptable:\n\n    # only allow strings (Str) in the Set\n    my $fruits = Set[Str].new( <peach apple orange apple apple> );\n\n    # only allow whole numbers (Int) in the Set\n    my $fruits = Set[Int].new( <peach apple orange apple apple> );\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"peach\")\n\nFinally, you can create Set masquerading as a hash by using the is trait:\n\n    my %s is Set = <a b c>;\n    say %s<a>;  # True\n    say %s<d>;  # False\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later), this syntax also allows you to specify the\ntype of values you would like to allow:\n\n    # limit to strings\n    my %s is Set[Str] = <a b c>;\n    say %s<a>;  # True\n    say %s<d>;  # False\n\n    # limit to whole numbers\n    my %s is Set[Int] = <a b c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\nRaku provides common set operators, which can take Sets (or any other\ncollections) as input, and return result sets as new Set objects. For\nexample:\n\n    my ($a, $b) = set(1, 2, 3), set(2, 4);\n\n    say $a (<) $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (&) $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(2)␤»\n    say $a (^) $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 3, 4)␤»\n\n    # Unicode versions:\n    say $a ⊂ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ∩ $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(2)␤»\n    say $a ⊖ $b;  # OUTPUT: «set(1, 3, 4)␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set

Please check the corresponding section in the\nexperimental features document\n\nUseful when storing and returning the computed value is much faster than\nre-computing it every time, and when the time saved trumps the cost of the\nuse of more memory.\n\nEven if the arguments passed to the routine are \"reference types\" (such as\nobjects or arrays), then for the purpose of caching they will only be\ncompared based on their contents. Thus the second invocation will hit the\ncache in this case:\n\n    say foo( [1, 2, 3] );   # runs foo\n    say foo( [1, 2, 3] );   # doesn't run foo, uses cached value\n\n\nSince it's still at the experimental stage, you will have to insert the use\nexperimental :cached; statement in any module or script that uses it.\n\n    use experimental :cached;\n\n    sub nth-prime(Int:D $x where * > 0) is cached {\n        say \"Calculating {$x}th prime\";\n        return (2..*).grep(*.is-prime)[$x - 1];\n    }\n\n    say nth-prime(43);\n    say nth-prime(43);\n    say nth-prime(43);\n\n\nproduces this output:\n\n    Calculating 43th prime\n    191\n    191\n    191\n\n\n  trait is pure\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$pure!)\n\nMarks a subroutine as pure, that is, it asserts that for the same input, it\nwill always produce the same output without any additional side effects.\n\nThe is pure trait is a promise by the programmer to the compiler that it\ncan constant-fold calls to such functions when the arguments are known at\ncompile time.\n\n    sub syllables() is pure {\n        say \"Generating syllables\";\n        my @vowels = <a e i o u>;\n        return  @vowels.append: <k m n sh d r t y> X~ @vowels;\n    }\n\nYou can mark function as pure even if they throw exceptions in edge cases\nor if they modify temporary objects; hence the is pure trait can cover\ncases that the compiler cannot deduce on its own. On the other hand, you\nmight not want to constant-fold functions that produce a large return value\n(such as the string or list repetition operators, infix x and xx) even if\nthey are pure, to avoid large precompilation files.\n\nTo see it an action with a particular compiler you can try this example:\n\n    BEGIN { say ‘Begin’ }\n    say ‘Start’;\n    say (^100).map: { syllables().pick(2..5).join(\"\") };\n\n\n    # Example output:\n    # Begin\n    # Generating syllables\n    # Start\n    # (matiroi yeterani shoriyuru...\n\n\nEssentially this allows the compiler to perform some operations at compile\ntime. The benefits of constant-folding may include better performance,\nespecially in cases when the folded code is precompiled.\n\nIn addition, using a pure function or operator in sink context (that is,\nwhere the result is discarded) may lead to a warning. The code\n\n    sub double($x) is pure { 2 * $x };\n    double(21);\n    say \"anything\";\n    # WARNING: «Useless use of \"double(21)\" in expression \"double(21)\" in sink context (line 2)»\n\nIf you want to apply this trait to a multi, you need to apply it to the\nproto; it will not work otherwise, at least in versions 2018.08 and below.\n\n  trait is rw\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$rw!)\n\nWhen a routine is modified with this trait, its return value will be\nwritable. This is useful when returning variables or writable elements of\nhashes or arrays, for example:\n\n    sub walk(\\thing, *@keys) is rw {\n        my $current := thing;\n        for @keys -> $k {\n            if $k ~~ Int {\n                $current := $current[$k];\n            }\n            else {\n                $current := $current{$k};\n            }\n        }\n        $current;\n    }\n\n    my %hash;\n    walk(%hash, 'some', 'key', 1, 2) = 'autovivified';\n\n    say %hash.perl;\n\n\nproduces\n\n    (\"some\" => {\"key\" => [Any, [Any, Any, \"autovivified\"]]}).hash\n\n\nNote that return marks return values as read only; if you need an early\nexit from an is rw routine, you have to use return-rw instead.\n\n  trait is export\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine $r, :$export!)\n\nMarks a routine as exported to the rest of the world\n\n    module Foo {\n        sub double($x) is export {\n            2 * $x\n        }\n    }\n\n    import Foo;         # makes sub double available\n    say double 21;      # 42\n\n\nFrom inside another file you'd say use Foo; to load a module and import the\nexported functions.\n\nSee Exporting and Selective Importing Modules for more details.\n\n  trait is DEPRECATED\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D $r, :$DEPRECATED!)\n\nMarks a routine as deprecated, optionally with a message what to use\ninstead.\n\nThis code\n\n    sub f() is DEPRECATED('the literal 42') { 42 }\n    say f();\n\n\nproduces this output:\n\n    42\n    Saw 1 occurrence of deprecated code.\n    ================================================================================\n    Sub f (from GLOBAL) seen at:\n      deprecated.p6, line 2\n    Please use the literal 42 instead.\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Please contact the author to have these occurrences of deprecated code\n    adapted, so that this message will disappear!\n\n\n  trait is hidden-from-backtrace\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D, :$hidden-from-backtrace!)\n\nHides a routine from showing up in a default backtrace. For example\n\n    sub inner { die \"OH NOEZ\" };\n    sub outer { inner() };\n    outer();\n\n\nproduces the error message and backtrace\n\n    OH NOEZ\n      in sub inner at bt.p6:1\n      in sub outer at bt.p6:2\n      in block <unit> at bt.p6:3\n\n\nbut if inner is marked with hidden-from-backtrace\n\n    sub inner is hidden-from-backtrace { die \"OH NOEZ\" };\n    sub outer { inner() };\n    outer();\n\n\nthe error backtrace does not show it:\n\n    OH NOEZ\n      in sub outer at bt.p6:2\n      in block <unit> at bt.p6:3\n\n\n  trait is default\n\nDefined as\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D $r, :$default!)\n\nThere is a special trait for Routines called is default. This trait is\ndesigned as a way to disambiguate multi calls that would normally throw an\nerror because the compiler would not know which one to use. This means that\ngiven the following two Routines, the one with the is default trait will be\ncalled.\n\n    multi sub f() is default { say \"Hello there\" }\n    multi sub f() { say \"Hello friend\" }\n    f();   # OUTPUT: «\"Hello there\"␤»\n\nThe is default trait can become very useful for debugging and other uses\nbut keep in mind that it will only resolve an ambiguous dispatch between\ntwo Routines of the same precedence. If one of the Routines is narrower\nthan another, then that one will be called. For example:\n\n    multi sub f() is default { say \"Hello there\" }\n    multi sub f(:$greet) { say \"Hello \" ~ $greet }\n    f();   # \"Use of uninitialized value $greet...\"\n\n\nIn this example, the multi without is default was called because it was\nactually narrower than the Sub with it.\n\n  trait is raw\n\nDefined as:\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Routine:D $r, :$raw!)\n\nGives total access to the data structure returned by the routine.\n\n    my @zipi = <zape zapatilla>;\n    sub þor() is raw {\n        return @zipi\n    };\n    þor()[1] = 'pantuflo';\n    say @zipi;  # OUTPUT: «[zape pantuflo]␤»","k":"m"},{"k":"m","d":"method package(Routine:D:)\n\nReturns the package in which the routine is defined.","m":0,"n":"package","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"leave","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*@","*%_"]}}],"n":"Routine","mro":["Callable","Block","Code","Any","Mu"]},{"k":"c","t":"NFC","d":"TITLE\nclass NFC\n\nSUBTITLE\nCodepoint string in Normal Form C (composed)\n\n    class NFC is Uni {}\n\nA Codepoint string in Unicode Normalization Form C.

Any positional parameters, regardless of their type, become\nelements of the mix - with a weight of 1 for each time the parameter\noccurred:\n\n    my $n = mix \"a\", \"a\", \"b\" => 0, 3.14, π, π; # The Pair is a single element\n    say $n.keys.map: *.^name; # OUTPUT: «(Rat Pair Num Str)␤»\n    say $n.pairs;\n    # OUTPUT: «(3.14 => 1 (b => 0) => 1 3.141592653589793 => 2 a => 2)␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .Mix coercer (or its functional form, Mix()) can be\ncalled on an existing object to coerce it to a Mix. Its semantics depend on\nthe type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the object in\nlist context and creates a mix with the resulting items as elements,\nalthough for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys become elements\nof the mix, and the (cumulative) values become the associated numeric\nweights:\n\n    my $n = (\"a\", \"a\", \"b\" => 0, \"c\" => 3.14).Mix;\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»\n    say $n.pairs;            # OUTPUT: «(a => 2 c => 3.14)␤»\n\nElements with a 0 value, as b above, are simply eliminated from the Mix.\n\nAlternatively, since Mixes are Associative, we can use the % sigil to\ndeclare them; in that case, we can employ is to declare their type:\n\n    my %n is Mix = (\"a\", \"a\", \"b\" => 0, \"c\" => 3.14);\n    say %n.^name; # OUTPUT: «Mix␤»\n    say %n;       # OUTPUT: «Mix(a(2), c(3.14))␤»\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) it is also possible to specify the type of\nvalues you would like to allow in a Mix. This can either be done when\ncalling .new:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my $n = Mix[Str].new: <a b b c c c>;\n\nor using the masquerading syntax:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my %m is Mix[Str] = <a b b c c c>;\n    say %m<b>;  # 2\n    say %m<d>;  # 0\n\n    # only allow whole numbers\n    my %m is Mix[Int] = <a b b c c c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\nMixes can use all kind of set operators returning either Bool or other\nMixes:\n\n    my $this-mix = (sugar => ⅓, spice => ¼, all-things-nice => ¾);\n    my $that-mix = ( sugar => 1, spice => 2);\n\n    say $that-mix (<) $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $that-mix (^) $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «set(all-things-nice)␤»\n    say $that-mix (+) $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «Bag(spice(2), sugar)␤»\n\n\nWith their equivalent Unicode operators:\n\n    say $that-mix ⊂ $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $that-mix ⊖ $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «set(all-things-nice)␤»\n    say $that-mix ⊎ $this-mix;     # OUTPUT: «Bag(spice(2), sugar)␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set and bag operators with\ndetailed explanations.\n\n  sub mix\n\n    sub mix(*@args --> Mix)\n\nCreates a new Mix from @args.\n\n","t":"Mix","k":"c"},{"b":"A","a":[{"k":"v","t":"HyperConfiguration","n":"$.configuration"},{"k":"v","t":"Rakudo::Internals::HyperWorkStage","n":"$!work-stage-head"},{"n":"$!list","k":"v","t":"Mu"}],"m":[{"n":"BUILD","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":[":configuration($!configuration)!",":work-stage-head($!work-stage-head)!","*%_"]},"k":"s"},{"m":0,"n":"iterator","s":{"r":"Iterator","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m","d":"method iterator(HyperSeq:D: --> Iterator:D)\n\nReturns the underlying iterator."},{"d":"method grep(HyperSeq:D: $matcher, *%options)\n\nApplies grep to the HyperSeq similarly to how it would do it on a Seq.\n\n    my @hyped = (^10000).map(*²).hyper;\n    @hyped.grep( * %% 3 ).say;\n    # OUTPUT: «(0 9 36 81 144…»\n\n\nWhen you use hyper on a Seq, this is the method that is actually called.","k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$matcher","*%options"]},"n":"grep","m":0},{"k":"m","d":"method map(HyperSeq:D: $matcher, *%options)\n\nUses maps on the HyperSeq, generally created by application of hyper to a\npreexisting Seq.","n":"map","m":0,"s":{"p":["$matcher","*%options"],"r":"Mu"}},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"invert","d":"method invert(HyperSeq:D:)\n\nInverts the HyperSeq created from a Seq by .hyper.","k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"hyper","m":0,"d":"method hyper(HyperSeq:D:)\n\nReturns the object.","k":"m"},{"d":"method race(HyperSeq:D:)\n\nCreates a RaceSeq object out of the current one.","k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"race"},{"d":"method is-lazy(--> False )\n\nReturns False.","k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Bool"},"n":"is-lazy","m":0},{"n":"sink","m":0,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    method sink(--> Nil)\n\nSinks the underlying data structure, producing any side effects."},{"m":0,"n":"configuration","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["@auto","%init","*%_"]},"n":"BUILDALL","m":0}],"mro":["Sequence","PositionalBindFailover","Iterable","Any","Mu"],"n":"HyperSeq","t":"HyperSeq","d":"TITLE\nclass HyperSeq\n\nSUBTITLE\nAn object for performing batches of work in parallel with ordered output\n\n    class HyperSeq does Iterable does Sequence { }\n\nAn HyperSeq is the intermediate object used when the operator hyper is\ninvoked on a Seq.

It acts as a wrapper around an Exception object.\n\nSink (void) context causes a Failure to throw, i.e. turn into a normal\nexception. The use fatal pragma causes this to happen in all contexts\nwithin the pragma's scope. Inside try blocks, use fatal is automatically\nset, and you can disable it with no fatal.\n\nThat means that Failures are generally only useful in cases of code that\nnormally would produce an rvalue; Failures are more or less equivalent to\nExceptions in code that will frequently be called in sink context (i.e.,\nfor its side-effects, such as with say).\n\nSimilarly, you should generally use &fail only inside code that is normally\nexpected to return something.\n\nChecking a Failure for truth (with the Bool method) or definedness (with\nthe defined method) marks the failure as handled, and causes it not to\nthrow in sink context anymore.\n\nYou can call the handled method to check if a failure has been handled.\n\nCalling methods on unhandled failures propagates the failure.

Using a\nCallable as replacement is how you can refer to any of the captures created\nin the regex:\n\n    # Using capture from $/ variable (the $0 is the first positional capture)\n    say 'abc123defg'.subst(/(\\d+)/, { \" before $0 after \" });\n    # OUTPUT: «abc before 123 after defg␤»\n\n    # Using capture from $/ variable (the $<foo> is a named capture)\n    say 'abc123defg'.subst(/$<foo>=\\d+/, { \" before $<foo> after \" });\n    # OUTPUT: «abc before 123 after defg␤»\n\n    # Using WhateverCode to operate on the Match given in $_:\n    say 'abc123defg'.subst(/(\\d+)/, \"[ \" ~ *.flip ~ \" ]\");\n    # OUTPUT: «abc[ 321 ]defg␤»\n\n    # Using a Callable to generate substitution without involving current Match:\n    my $i = 41;\n    my $str = \"The answer is secret.\";\n    say $str.subst(/secret/, {++$i}); # The answer to everything\n    # OUTPUT: «The answer is 42.␤»\n\n    Adverbs\n\nThe following adverbs are supported\n\n  short                        long        meaning\n  :g                           :global     tries to match as often as possible\n  :nth(Int|Callable|Whatever)              only substitute the nth match; aliases: :st, :nd, :rd, and :th\n  :ss                          :samespace  preserves whitespace on substitution\n  :ii                          :samecase   preserves case on substitution\n  :mm                          :samemark   preserves character marks (e.g. 'ü' replaced with 'o' will result in 'ö')\n  :x(Int|Range|Whatever)                   substitute exactly $x matches\n\n\nNote that only in the s/// form :ii implies :i and :ss implies :s. In the\nmethod form, the :s and :i modifiers must be added to the regex, not the\nsubst method call.\n\n    More Examples\n\nHere are other examples of usage:\n\n    my $str = \"Hey foo foo foo\";\n    $str.subst(/foo/, \"bar\", :g); # global substitution - returns Hey bar bar bar\n\n    $str.subst(/foo/, \"no subst\", :x(0)); # targeted substitution. Number of times to substitute. Returns back unmodified.\n    $str.subst(/foo/, \"bar\", :x(1)); #replace just the first occurrence.\n\n    $str.subst(/foo/, \"bar\", :nth(3)); # replace nth match alone. Replaces the third foo. Returns Hey foo foo bar\n\nThe :nth adverb has readable English-looking variants:\n\n    say 'ooooo'.subst: 'o', 'x', :1st; # OUTPUT: «xoooo␤»\n    say 'ooooo'.subst: 'o', 'x', :2nd; # OUTPUT: «oxooo␤»\n    say 'ooooo'.subst: 'o', 'x', :3rd; # OUTPUT: «ooxoo␤»\n    say 'ooooo'.subst: 'o', 'x', :4th; # OUTPUT: «oooxo␤»","k":"m"},{"m":1,"n":"lines","s":{"p":[":$count!","*%_"],"r":"Int:D"},"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    multi method lines(Str:D: $limit)\n    multi method lines(Str:D:)\n\nReturns a list of lines (without trailing newline characters), i.e. the\nsame as a call to $input.comb( / ^^ \\N* /, $limit ) would.\n\nExamples:\n\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").perl;    # OUTPUT: «(\"a\", \"b\").Seq␤»\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").elems;   # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\nb\".lines.elems;    # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\n\".lines.elems;     # OUTPUT: «1␤»\n\nYou can limit the number of lines returned by setting the $limit variable\nto a non-zero, non-Infinity value:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( 2 ); # OUTPUT: «(not there)␤»\n\nDEPRECATED as of 6.d language, the :count argument was used to return the\ntotal number of lines:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( :count ); # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n\nUse elems call on the returned Seq instead:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines.elems; # OUTPUT: «3␤»"},{"s":{"p":["$limit","*%_"],"r":"Seq:D"},"n":"lines","m":1,"d":"Defined as:\n\n    multi method lines(Str:D: $limit)\n    multi method lines(Str:D:)\n\nReturns a list of lines (without trailing newline characters), i.e. the\nsame as a call to $input.comb( / ^^ \\N* /, $limit ) would.\n\nExamples:\n\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").perl;    # OUTPUT: «(\"a\", \"b\").Seq␤»\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").elems;   # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\nb\".lines.elems;    # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\n\".lines.elems;     # OUTPUT: «1␤»\n\nYou can limit the number of lines returned by setting the $limit variable\nto a non-zero, non-Infinity value:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( 2 ); # OUTPUT: «(not there)␤»\n\nDEPRECATED as of 6.d language, the :count argument was used to return the\ntotal number of lines:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( :count ); # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n\nUse elems call on the returned Seq instead:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines.elems; # OUTPUT: «3␤»","k":"m"},{"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    multi method lines(Str:D: $limit)\n    multi method lines(Str:D:)\n\nReturns a list of lines (without trailing newline characters), i.e. the\nsame as a call to $input.comb( / ^^ \\N* /, $limit ) would.\n\nExamples:\n\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").perl;    # OUTPUT: «(\"a\", \"b\").Seq␤»\n    say lines(\"a\\nb\").elems;   # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\nb\".lines.elems;    # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n    say \"a\\n\".lines.elems;     # OUTPUT: «1␤»\n\nYou can limit the number of lines returned by setting the $limit variable\nto a non-zero, non-Infinity value:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( 2 ); # OUTPUT: «(not there)␤»\n\nDEPRECATED as of 6.d language, the :count argument was used to return the\ntotal number of lines:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines( :count ); # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n\nUse elems call on the returned Seq instead:\n\n    say <not there yet>.join(\"\\n\").lines.elems; # OUTPUT: «3␤»","n":"lines","m":1,"s":{"r":"Seq:D","p":["*%_"]}},{"s":{"p":["Int:D $radix","*%_"],"r":"Numeric:D"},"m":0,"n":"parse-base","d":"multi sub    parse-base(Str:D $num, Int:D $radix --> Numeric)\n    multi method parse-base(Str:D $num: Int:D $radix --> Numeric)\n\nPerforms the reverse of base by converting a string with a base-$radix\nnumber to its Numeric equivalent.

You can simply append .IO to the\nfilename. For instance, here is how to check whether a file is readable\nusing smartmatch:\n\n    '/path/to/file'.IO ~~ :r;\n\nFile tests include:\n\n  * :d (Directory)\n\n  * :e (Exists)\n\n  * :f (File)\n\n  * :l (Symbolic link)\n\n  * :r (Readable)\n\n  * :rw (Readable and writable)\n\n  * :rwx (Readable, writable and executable)\n\n  * :s (Size)\n\n  * :w (Writable)\n\n  * :x (Executable)\n\n  * :z (Zero size)\n\nSmartmatching on Pairs can be used to perform multiple tests at once:\n\n    say :d & :x;                # OUTPUT: «all(d => True, x => True)␤»\n    say '/tmp'.IO ~~ :d & :x;   # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say '/'.IO    ~~ :d & :rw;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nAll of the above tests can be used as methods (without the colon), though\nmethod tests may throw X::IO::DoesNotExist as documented below. Three tests\nonly exist as methods: accessed, changed and modified.\n\nYou can also perform file tests on an already opened filehandle by testing\nagainst its .path method.

That is,\nspecifying, for example, .open(:r :create) or .open(:mode<wo> :append\n:truncate) might work or might cause the Universe to implode, depending on\na particular implementation. This applies to reads/writes to a handle\nopened in such unsupported modes as well.\n\nThe mode details are:\n\n    :mode<ro>  means \"read only\"\n    :mode<wo>  means \"write only\"\n    :mode<rw>  means \"read and write\"\n\n    :create    means the file will be created, if it does not exist\n    :truncate  means the file will be emptied, if it exists\n    :exclusive means .open will fail if the file already exists\n    :append    means writes will be done at the end of file's current contents\n\n\nAttempts to open a directory, write to a handle opened in read-only mode or\nread from a handle opened in write-only mode, or using text-reading methods\non a handle opened in binary mode will fail or throw.\n\nIn 6.c language, it's possible to open path '-', which will cause open to\nopen (if closed) the $*IN handle if opening in read-only mode or to open\nthe $*OUT handle if opening in write-only mode.

While they will get closed when garbage\ncollected, garbage collection isn't guaranteed to get run. This means you\nshould use an explicit close on handles opened for writing, to avoid data\nloss, and an explicit close is recommended on handles opened for reading as\nwell, so that your program does not open too many files at the same time,\ntriggering exceptions on further open calls.\n\nNote (Rakudo versions 2017.09 and after): Open filehandles are\nautomatically closed on program exit, but it is still highly recommended\nthat you close opened handles explicitly.","k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"out-buffer","m":0,"d":"Defined as:\n\n    method out-buffer(--> Int:D) is rw\n\nControls output buffering and can be set via an argument to open.

It is the default container type associated\nwith the $ sigil. A literal Scalar may be placed around a literal value by\nenclosing the value in $(…). This notation will appear in the output of a\n.perl method in certain places where it is important to note the presence\nof Scalars.\n\nWhen a value is assigned to a $-sigiled variable, the variable will\nactually bind to a Scalar, which in turn will bind to the value. When a\nScalar is assigned to a $-sigiled variable, the value bound to by that\nScalar will be bound to the Scalar which that variable was bound to (a new\none will be created if necessary.)\n\nIn addition, Scalars delegate all method calls to the value which they\ncontain. As such, Scalars are for the most part invisible. There is,\nhowever, one important place where Scalars have a visible impact: a Scalar\nwill shield its content from flattening by most Raku core list operations.\n\nA $-sigiled variable may be bound directly to a value with no intermediate\nScalar using the binding operator :=. You can tell if this has been done by\nexamining the output of the introspective pseudo-method .VAR:\n\n    my $a = 1;\n    $a.^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    $a.VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»\n    my $b := 1;\n    $b.^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    $b.VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n\nThis same thing happens when values are assigned to an element of an Array,\nhowever, Lists directly contain their values:\n\n    my @a = 1, 2, 3;\n    @a[0].^name.say;            # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    @a[0].VAR.^name.say;        # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»\n    [1, 2, 3][0].^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    [1, 2, 3][0].VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»\n    (1, 2, 3)[0].^name.say;     # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    (1, 2, 3)[0].VAR.^name.say; # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n\nArray elements may be bound directly to values using := as well; however,\nthis is discouraged as it may lead to confusion. Doing so will break exact\nround-tripping of .perl output – since Arrays are assumed to place Scalars\naround each element, Scalars are not denoted with $ in the output of\nArray.perl.\n\n    [1, $(2, 3)].perl.say;     # OUTPUT: «[1, (2, 3)]␤»\n    (1, $(2, 3)).perl.say;     # OUTPUT: «(1, $(2, 3))␤»\n\nBinding a Scalar to a $-sigiled variable replaces the existing Scalar in\nthat variable, if any, with the given Scalar. That means more than one\nvariable may refer to the same Scalar. Because the Scalar may be mutated,\nthis makes it possible to alter the value of both variables by altering\nonly one of them:\n\n    my $a = 1;\n    my $b := $a;\n    $b = 2;\n    $a.say;       # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n\n SSA-style constants bind directly to their value with no intervening\nScalar, even when assignment (=) is used. They may be forced to use a\nScalar by assigning a $-sigiled variable to them, at which point, they\nbehave entirely like $-sigiled variables.\n\n    my \\c = 1;\n    c.^name.say;             # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    c.VAR.^name.say;         # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    my $a = 1;\n    my \\d = $a;              # just \"my \\d = $ = 1\" works, too\n    d.^name.say;             # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    d.VAR.^name.say;         # OUTPUT: «Scalar␤»\n    d = 2;                   # ok\n    c = 2;                   # fails\n    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };\n    # OUTPUT: «X::Assignment::RO: Cannot modify an immutable Int␤»\n\nAtomic operations on Scalar\n\nA Scalar can have its value changed using a hardware-supported atomic\ncompare and swap operation. This is useful when implementing lock free data\nstructures and algorithms. It may also be fetched and assigned to in an\n\"atomic\" fashion, which ensures appropriate memory barriering and prevents\nunwanted optimizations of memory accesses.\n\nA Scalar that will be used with an atomic operation should always be\nexplicitly initialized with a value before any atomic operations are\nperformed upon it. This is to avoid races with lazy allocation and\nauto-vivification. For example:\n\n    cas(@a[5], $expected, $value)\n\n\nWill work in principle since an Array consists of Scalar containers.\nHowever, the container is only bound into the array upon initial\nassignment. Therefore, there would be a race to do that binding. The Scalar\natomic operations will never check for or do any such auto-vivification, so\nas to make such bugs much more evident (rather than only observed under\nstress).\n\nIntrospection\n\n  method of\n\n    method of(Scalar:D: --> Mu)\n\nReturns the type constraint of the container.\n\nExample:\n\n    my Cool $x = 42;\n    say $x.VAR.of;                  # OUTPUT: «(Cool)»\n\n  method default\n\n    method default(Scalar:D: --> Str)\n\nReturns the default value associated with the container.\n\nExample:\n\n    my $x is default(666) = 42;\n    say $x.VAR.default;             # OUTPUT: «666»\n\n  method name\n\n    method name(Scalar:D: --> Str)\n\nReturns the name associated with the container.\n\nExample:\n\n    my $x = 42;\n    say $x.VAR.name;                # OUTPUT: «$x»\n\n  method dynamic\n\n    method dynamic(Scalar:D: --> Bool)\n\nReturns whether the variable is visible in dynamic variable lookups.\n\nExample:\n\n    my $*FOO = 42;\n    say $*FOO.VAR.dynamic;          # OUTPUT: «True»\n\nRoutines\n\n  sub atomic-assign\n\nDefined as:\n\n    multi sub atomic-assign($target is rw, $value)\n\nPerforms an atomic assignment of $value into the Scalar $target. The\natomic-assign routine ensures that any required barriers are performed such\nthat the changed value will be \"published\" to other threads.\n\n  sub atomic-fetch\n\n    multi sub atomic-fetch($target is rw)\n\nPerforms an atomic read of the value in the Scalar $target and returns the\nread value. Using this routine instead of simply using the variable ensures\nthat the latest update to the variable from other threads will be seen,\nboth by doing any required hardware barriers and also preventing the\ncompiler from lifting reads. For example:\n\n    my $started = False;\n    start { atomic-assign($started, True) }\n    until atomic-fetch($started) { }\n\nIs certain to terminate, while in:\n\n    my $started = False;\n    start { atomic-assign($started, True) }\n    until $started { }\n\nIt would be legal for a compiler to observe that $started is not updated in\nthe loop, and so lift the read out of the loop, thus causing the program to\nnever terminate.\n\n  sub cas\n\nDefined as:\n\n    multi sub cas($target is rw, $expected, $value)\n    multi sub cas($target is rw, &operation)\n\nPerforms an atomic compare and swap of the value in the Scalar $target. The\nfirst form has semantics like:\n\n    my $seen = $target;\n    if $seen<> =:= $expected<> {\n        $target = $value;\n    }\n    return $seen;\n\n\nExcept it is performed as a single hardware-supported atomic instruction,\nas if all memory access to $target were blocked while it took place.\nTherefore it is safe to attempt the operation from multiple threads without\nany other synchronization. Since it is a reference comparison, this\noperation is usually not sensible on value types.\n\nFor example:\n\n    constant NOT_STARTED = Any.new;\n    constant STARTED = Any.new;\n    my $master = NOT_STARTED;\n    await start {\n        if cas($master, NOT_STARTED, STARTED) === NOT_STARTED {\n            say \"Master!\"\n        }\n    } xx 4\n\nWill reliably only ever print Master! one time, as only one of the threads\nwill be successful in changing the Scalar from NOT_STARTED to STARTED.\n\nThe second form, taking a code object, will first do an atomic fetch of the\ncurrent value and invoke the code object with it. It will then try to do an\natomic compare and swap of the target, using the value passed to the code\nobject as $expected and the result of the code object as $value. If this\nfails, it will read the latest value, and retry, until a CAS operation\nsucceeds.\n\nTherefore, an item could be added to the head of a linked list in a lock\nfree manner as follows:\n\n    class Node {\n        has $.value;\n        has Node $.next;\n    }\n    my Node $head = Node;\n    await start {\n        for ^1000 -> $value {\n            cas $head, -> $next { Node.new(:$value, :$next) }\n        }\n    } xx 4;\n\nThis will reliably build up a linked list of 4000 items, with 4 nodes with\neach value ranging from 0 up to 999.\n\nOperators\n\n  infix ⚛=\n\n    multi sub infix:<⚛=>($target is rw, $value)\n\nPerforms an atomic assignment of $value into the Scalar $target. The ⚛=\noperator ensures that any required barriers are performed such that the\nchanged value will be \"published\" to other threads.\n\n  prefix ⚛\n\n    multi sub prefix:<⚛>($target is rw)\n\nPerforms an atomic read of the value in the Scalar $target and returns the\nread value. Using this operator instead of simply using the variable\nensures that the latest update to the variable from other threads will be\nseen, both by doing any required hardware barriers and also preventing the\ncompiler from lifting reads. For example:\n\n    my $started = False;\n    start { $started ⚛= True }\n    until ⚛$started { }\n\nIs certain to terminate, while in:\n\n    my $started = False;\n    start { $started ⚛= True }\n    until $started { }\n\nIt would be legal for a compiler to observe that $started is not updated in\nthe loop, and so lift the read out of the loop, thus causing the program to\nnever terminate.","m":[{"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"new","k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"name","k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"of"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"default","k":"m"},{"n":"dynamic","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m"}],"n":"Scalar","mro":["Any","Mu"],"b":"A"},{"k":"v","t":"Sub","n":"&exit"},{"k":"s","n":"exit","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":[]}},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$status"]},"m":1,"n":"exit","k":"s"},{"n":"&fail","k":"v","t":"Sub"},{"s":{"p":[],"r":"Nil"},"m":1,"n":"fail","k":"s"},{"s":{"p":["Exception:U

Bag\n\nSUBTITLE\nImmutable collection of distinct objects with integer weights\n\n    class Bag does Baggy { }\n\nA Bag is an immutable bag/multiset implementing Associative, meaning a\ncollection of distinct elements in no particular order that each have an\ninteger weight assigned to them signifying how many copies of that element\nare considered \"in the bag\". (For mutable bags, see BagHash instead.)\n\nBags are often used for performing weighted random selections - see .pick\nand .roll.\n\nObjects/values of any type are allowed as bag elements. Within a Bag, items\nthat would compare positively with the === operator are considered the same\nelement, with the number of how many there are as its weight. But of course\nyou can also easily get back the expanded list of items (without the\norder):\n\n    my $breakfast = bag <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam>;\n\n    say $breakfast.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    say $breakfast.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «bacon eggs spam␤»\n\n    say $breakfast.total;      # OUTPUT: «6␤»\n    say $breakfast.kxxv.sort;  # OUTPUT: «bacon eggs spam spam spam spam␤»\n\n\nBags can be treated as object hashes using the { } postcircumfix operator,\nor the < >  operator for literal string keys, which returns the\ncorresponding integer weight for keys that are elements of the bag, and 0\nfor keys that aren't:\n\n    my $breakfast = bag <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam>;\n    say $breakfast<bacon>;    # OUTPUT: «1␤»\n    say $breakfast<spam>;     # OUTPUT: «4␤»\n    say $breakfast<sausage>;  # OUTPUT: «0␤»\n\nCreating Bag objects\n\nBags can be composed using the bag subroutine (or Bag.new, for which it is\na shorthand). Any positional parameters, regardless of their type, become\nelements of the bag:\n\n    my $n = bag \"a\" => 0, \"b\" => 1, \"c\" => 2, \"c\" => 2;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(:c(2), :b(1), :a(0)).Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Pair) (Pair) (Pair))␤»\n    say $n.values.perl;      # OUTPUT: «(2, 1, 1).Seq␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .Bag coercer (or its functional form, Bag()) can be\ncalled on an existing object to coerce it to a Bag. Its semantics depend on\nthe type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the object in\nlist context and creates a bag with the resulting items as elements,\nalthough for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys become elements\nof the bag, and the (cumulative) values become the associated integer\nweights:\n\n    my $n = (\"a\" => 0, \"b\" => 1, \"c\" => 2, \"c\" => 2).Bag;\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(\"b\", \"c\").Seq␤»\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»\n    say $n.values.perl;      # OUTPUT: «(1, 4).Seq␤»\n\nFurthermore, you can get a Bag by using bag operators (see next section) on\nobjects of other types such as List, which will act like they internally\ncall .Bag on them before performing the operation. Be aware of the tight\nprecedence of those operators though, which may require you to use\nparentheses around arguments:\n\n    say (1..5) (+) 4;  # OUTPUT: «bag(1, 2, 3, 4(2), 5)␤»\n\nOf course, you can also create a Bag with the .new method.\n\n    my $breakfast = Bag.new( <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam> );\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) you can also use this syntax for\nparameterization of the Bag, to specify which type of values are\nacceptable:\n\n    # only allow strings (Str) in the Bag\n    my $breakfast = Bag[Str].new( <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam> );\n\n    # only allow whole numbers (Int) in the Bag\n    my $breakfast = Bag[Int].new( <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam> );\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"spam\")\n\nFinally, you can create Bag masquerading as a hash by using the is trait:\n\n    my %b is Bag = <a b c>;\n    say %b<a>;  # True\n    say %b<d>;  # False\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later), this syntax also allows you to specify the\ntype of values you would like to allow:\n\n    # limit to strings\n    my %b is Bag[Str] = <a b c>;\n    say %b<a>;  # True\n    say %b<d>;  # False\n\n    # limit to whole numbers\n    my %b is Bag[Int] = <a b c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\nRaku provides common set and bag operators, which can take Bags (or any\nother collections) as input, and return result as Bool, Set or Bag values.\nFor example:\n\n    my ($a, $b) = bag(2, 2, 4), bag(2, 3, 3, 4);\n\n    say $a (<) $b;   # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (<+) $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (^) $b;   # OUTPUT: «bag(3(2), 2)␤»\n    say $a (+) $b;   # OUTPUT: «bag(2(3), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n    # Unicode versions:\n    say $a ⊂ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ≼ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ⊖ $b;  # OUTPUT: «bag(3(2), 2)␤»\n    say $a ⊎ $b;  # OUTPUT: «bag(2(3), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set and bag operators with\ndetailed explanations.\n\nSubroutines\n\n  sub bag\n\n    sub bag(*@args --> Bag)\n\nCreates a new Bag from @args.\n\nNote on reverse and ordering\n\nThis method is inherited from Any, however, Mixes do not have an inherent\norder and you should not trust it returning a consistent output.\n\nSee also\n\nSets, Bags, and Mixes","t":"Bag","k":"c"},{"k":"ro","d":"TITLE\nrole Iterable\n\nSUBTITLE\nInterface for container objects that can be iterated over\n\n    role Iterable { }\n\nIterable serves as an API for objects that can be iterated with for and\nrelated iteration constructs, like assignment to a Positional variable.\n\nIterable objects nested in other Iterable objects (but not within scalar\ncontainers) flatten in certain contexts, for example when passed to a\nslurpy parameter (*@a), or on explicit calls to flat.\n\nIts most important aspect is a method stub for iterator.\n\n    class DNA does Iterable {\n        has $.chain;\n        method new ($chain where { $chain ~~ /^^ <[ACGT]>+ $$ / } ) {\n            self.bless( :$chain );\n        }\n\n        method iterator(DNA:D:) {\n            $!chain.comb.rotor(3).iterator;\n        }\n    }\n\n    my $a := DNA.new('GAATCC');\n    .say for $a; # OUTPUT: «(G A A)␤(T C C)␤»\n\n\nThis example mixes in the Iterable role to offer a new way of iterating\nover what is essentially a string (constrained by where to just the four\nDNA letters).

A\nSeq is born in a state where iterating it will consume the values. However,\ncalling .cache on a Seq will return a List that is still lazy, but stores\nthe generated values for later access. However, assigning a Seq to an array\nconsumes the Seq; alternatively, you can use the lazy statement prefix to\navoid it from being iterated during the assignment:\n\n    # The Seq created by gather ... take is consumed on the spot here.\n    my @a = gather do { say 'consuming...'; take 'one' };  # OUTPUT: «consuming...␤»\n\n    # The Seq here is only consumed as we iterate over @a later.\n    my @a = lazy gather do { say 'consuming...'; take 'one' };  # outputs nothing.\n    .say for @a;  # OUTPUT: «consuming...␤one␤»\n\n\nA typical use case is method lines in IO::Handle, which could use a lot of\nmemory if it stored all the lines read from the file. So\n\n    for open('README.md').lines -> $line {\n        say $line;\n    }\n\n\nwon't keep all lines from the file in memory.\n\nThis implies that you cannot iterate the same Seq object twice (otherwise\nit couldn't throw away old values), so this dies:\n\n    my @a = 1, 2, 3;\n    my @b = <a b c>;\n    my \\c = @a Z=> @b;\n    .say for c;\n    .say for c; # fails\n    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };\n    # OUTPUT: «X::Seq::Consumed: This Seq has already been iterated, and its values consumed\n    # (you might solve this by adding .cache on usages of the Seq, or\n    # by assigning the Seq into an array)»\n\nA high-level construct to generate a Seq is gather/take, as well as many\nbuilt-in methods like map and grep, low-level constructors to create a Seq\nfrom an iterator or from looping constructs are available too.\n\nCaution: No program should ever assume a Seq may only be iterated once even\nif not cached by the program. Caching is a volatile state exposed to the\ndeveloper as an optimization. The Seq may become cached by many operations,\nincluding calling perl on the Seq (if called prior to a non-cached\niteration). From version 6.d, you .perl can be called on consumed <Seq>. If\na program assumes a Seq can only iterate once, but then is later changed to\ncall one of these operations during the loop, that assumption will fail.\n\n","m":[{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Iterator:D $iter","*%_"]},"n":"new","m":0,"d":"method new(Iterator:D $iter --> Seq:D)\n\nCreates a new Seq object from the iterator passed as the single argument.","k":"m"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"new-consumed","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"m":0,"n":"iterator","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m","d":"method iterator(Seq:D: --> Iterator:D)\n\nReturns the underlying iterator, and marks the invocant as consumed.

You can use, however, other alphabets like here:\n\n    駱駝道: while True {\n      say 駱駝道.name;\n      last 駱駝道;\n    }\n\n","k":"c"},{"n":"PF_UNIX","t":"ProtocolFamily","k":"e"},{"n":"&permutations","t":"Sub","k":"v"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Seq:D","p":["\\n"]},"m":1,"n":"permutations"},{"m":1,"n":"permutations","s":{"p":["Iterable \\n"],"r":"Seq:D"},"k":"s"},{"n":"More","t":"Order","k":"e"},{"t":"SeekType","k":"e","n":"SeekType"},{"n":"SeekType::SeekFromCurrent","k":"e","t":"SeekType"},{"t":"SeekType","k":"e","n":"SeekType::SeekFromBeginning"},{"t":"SeekType","k":"e","n":"SeekType::SeekFromEnd"},{"n":"&infix:<⊂>","k":"v","t":"Sub+{Callable[Bool:D]}+{is-pure}+{Precedence}"},{"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Setty:D \\a","Setty:D \\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Setty:D \\a","Mixy:D \\b"]}},{"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Setty:D \\a","Baggy:D \\b"]},"n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1,"k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Setty:D \\a","\\b"]},"n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1,"k":"s"},{"s":{"p":["Mixy:D \\a","Mixy:D \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"s":{"p":["Mixy:D \\a","Baggy:D \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1,"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Mixy:D \\a","\\b"]}},{"s":{"p":["Baggy:D \\a","Mixy:D \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Baggy:D \\a","Baggy:D \\b"]},"k":"s"},{"s":{"p":["Baggy:D \\a","\\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1,"k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","Mixy:D \\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","Baggy:D \\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","k":"s"},{"n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1,"s":{"p":["Failure:D \\a","$"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:«(<)»","s":{"p":["$","Failure:D \\b"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","\\b"]},"n":"infix:«(<)»","m":1},{"a":[{"n":"$!reified","k":"v","t":"Mu"},{"t":"Mu","k":"v","n":"$!todo"}],"b":"C","mro":["Positional","Iterable","List","Cool","Any","Mu"],"n":"Empty","t":"Slip","k":"c"},{"t":"Sub+{is-pure}+{Precedence}","k":"v","n":"&infix:<^..>"},{"n":"infix:<^..>","m":1,"s":{"p":["$min","$max"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"t":"num32","k":"n","n":"num32"},{"t":"Signal","k":"e","n":"SIGEMT"},{"n":"SIGINFO","k":"e","t":"Signal"},{"n":"&prefix:<⚛>","k":"v","t":"Sub"},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["$source is rw"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"prefix:<⚛>"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"prefix:<⚛>","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["atomicint $source is rw"]}},{"b":"C","n":"SoftRoutine","mro":[],"t":"SoftRoutine","k":"ro"},{"mro":["Cool","Any","Mu"],"m":[{"d":"method new(*@)\n\nReturns Nil","k":"m","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["*@","*%_"]},"n":"new","m":0},{"n":"Numeric","m":0,"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m","d":"method Numeric()\n\nWarns the user that they tried to numify a Nil."},{"k":"m","d":"method Str()\n\nWarns the user that they tried to stringify a Nil.","n":"Str","m":0,"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Nil"},"m":0,"n":"sink"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["|"]},"m":0,"n":"AT-POS"},{"k":"m","n":"AT-KEY","m":0,"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Nil"}},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"BIND-POS","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"BIND-KEY","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"ASSIGN-POS","m":0},{"k":"m","n":"ASSIGN-KEY","m":0,"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"STORE","m":0},{"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"push","m":0,"d":"method push(*@)\n\nWarns the user that they tried to push onto a Nil.","k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"append","m":0,"d":"method append(*@)\n\nWarns the user that they tried to append onto a Nil.","k":"m"},{"d":"method unshift(*@)\n\nWarns the user that they tried to unshift onto a Nil.","k":"m","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"unshift","m":0},{"m":0,"n":"prepend","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["|"]},"k":"m","d":"method prepend(*@)\n\nWarns the user that they tried to prepend onto a Nil."},{"s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Nil"},"m":0,"n":"FALLBACK","d":"method FALLBACK(| --> Nil) {}\n\nThe fallback method takes any arguments and always returns a Nil.","k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"ords","k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"chrs","m":0},{"k":"m","n":"chop","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"chomp","m":0,"k":"m"},{"n":"iterator","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"Set","m":0},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"SetHash"},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"Bag","m":0,"k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"BagHash","k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"n":"Mix","m":0,"k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"MixHash","k":"m"}],"n":"Nil","b":"C","k":"c","t":"Nil","d":"TITLE\nclass Nil\n\nSUBTITLE\nAbsence of a value or a benign failure\n\n    class Nil is Cool { }\n\nThe value Nil may be used to fill a spot where a value would normally go,\nand in so doing, explicitly indicate that no value is present. It may also\nbe used as a cheaper and less explosive alternative to a Failure. (In fact,\nclass Failure is derived from Nil, so smartmatching Nil will also match\nFailure.)\n\nThe class Nil is the same exact thing as its only possible value, Nil.\n\n    say Nil === Nil.new;        # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nAlong with Failure, Nil and its sub classes may always be returned from a\nroutine even when the routine specifies a particular return type. It may\nalso be returned regardless of the definedness of the return type, however,\nNil is considered undefined for all other purposes.\n\n    sub a( --> Int:D ) { return Nil }\n    a().say;                    # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n\nNil is what is returned from empty routines or closure, or routines that\nuse a bare return statement.\n\n    sub a { }; a().say;         # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    sub b { return }; b().say;  # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    say (if 1 { });             # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    { ; }().say;                # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    say EVAL \"\";                # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n\nIn a list, Nil takes the space of one value. Iterating a Nil behaves like\niteration of any non-iterable value, producing a sequence of one Nil. (When\nyou need the other meaning, the special value Empty is available to take no\nspaces when inserted into list, and to return no values when iterated.)\n\n    (1, Nil, 3).elems.say;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    (for Nil { $_ }).perl.say;  # OUTPUT: «(Nil,)␤»\n\nAny method call on Nil of a method that does not exist, and consequently,\nany subscripting operation, will succeed and return Nil.\n\n    say Nil.ITotallyJustMadeThisUp;  # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    say (Nil)[100];                  # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n    say (Nil){100};                  # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n\n When assigned to a container, the Nil value (but not any subclass of Nil)\nwill attempt to revert the container to its default value; if no such\ndefault is declared, Raku assumes Any.\n\nSince a hash assignment expects two elements, use Empty not Nil, e.g.\n\n    my %h = 'a'..'b' Z=> 1..*;\n    # stuff happens\n    %h = Empty; # %h = Nil will generate an error\n\nHowever, if the container type is constrained with :D, assigning Nil to it\nwill immediately throw an exception. (In contrast, an instantiated Failure\nmatches :D because it's a definite value, but will fail to match the actual\nnominal type unless it happens to be a parent class of Failure.)

When tapping into a\nlive supply, the tap will only see values that are flowing through the\nsupply after the tap has been created. Such supplies are normally infinite\nin nature, such as mouse movements. Closing such a tap does not stop mouse\nevents from occurring, it just means that the values will go by unseen. All\ntappers see the same flow of values.\n\nA tap on an on demand supply will initiate the production of values, and\ntapping the supply again may result in a new set of values. For example,\nSupply.interval produces a fresh timer with the appropriate interval each\ntime it is tapped. If the tap is closed, the timer simply stops emitting\nvalues to that tap.\n\nA live Supply is obtained from the Supplier factory method Supply. New\nvalues are emitted by calling emit on the Supplier object.\n\n    my $supplier = Supplier.new;\n    my $supply = $supplier.Supply;\n    $supply.tap(-> $v { say \"$v\" });\n    $supplier.emit(42); # Will cause the tap to output \"42\"\n\nThe live method returns True on live supplies. Factory methods such as\ninterval, from-list will return on demand supplies.\n\nA live Supply that keeps values until tapped the first time can be created\nwith Supplier::Preserving.\n\nFurther examples can be found in the concurrency page.\n\n","t":"Supply","k":"c","a":[{"k":"v","t":"Tappable","n":"$!tappable"}],"b":"A","m":[{"m":1,"n":"new","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["Tappable $tappable","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"new","m":1},{"k":"s","m":0,"n":"BUILD","s":{"p":["Tappable :tappable($!tappable)!","*%_"],"r":"Nil"}},{"d":"Defined as:\n\n    method Capture(Supply:D --> Capture:D)\n\nEquivalent to calling .List.Capture on the invocant.","k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"Capture","m":0},{"m":0,"n":"live","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m","d":"method live(Supply:D: --> Bool:D)\n\nReturns True if the supply is \"live\", that is, values are emitted to taps\nas soon as they arrive.

The first positional argument is a piece of code that will\nbe called when a new value becomes available through the emit call.\n\nThe &done callback can be called in a number of cases: if a supply block is\nbeing tapped, when a done routine is reached; if a supply block is being\ntapped, it will be automatically triggered if the supply block reaches the\nend; if the done method is called on the parent Supplier (in the case of a\nsupply block, if there are multiple Suppliers referenced by whenever, they\nmust all have their done method invoked for this to trigger the &done\ncallback of the tap as the block will then reach its end).\n\nThe &quit callback is called if the tap is on a supply block which exits\nwith an error. It is also called if the quit method is invoked on the\nparent Supplier (in the case of a supply block any one Supplier quitting\nwith an uncaught exception will call the &quit callback as the block will\nexit with an error). The error is passed as a parameter to the callback.\n\nThe &tap callback is called once the Tap object is created, which is passed\nas a parameter to the callback. The callback is called ahead of\nemit/done/quit, providing a reliable way to get the Tap object. One case\nwhere this is useful is when the Supply begins emitting values\nsynchronously, since the call to .tap won't return the Tap object until it\nis done emitting, preventing it from being stopped if needed.\n\nMethod tap returns an object of type Tap, on which you can call the close\nmethod to cancel the subscription.\n\n    my $s = Supply.from-list(0 .. 5);\n    my $t = $s.tap(-> $v { say $v }, done => { say \"no more ticks\" });\n\nProduces:\n\n    0\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    no more ticks","k":"m"},{"s":{"p":["&actor","*%others"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"act","m":0,"d":"method act(Supply:D: &act --> Tap:D)\n\nCreates a tap on the given supply with the given code.

Since any regex does Callable introspection\nrequires referencing via &-sigil.\n\n    my regex R { \\N };\n    say &R.^name; # OUTPUT: «Regex␤»\n\nTo match a string against a regex, you can use the smartmatch operator:\n\n    my $match = 'abc' ~~ rx/ ^ab /;\n    say $match.Bool;                # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $match.orig;                # OUTPUT: «abc␤»\n    say $match.Str;                 # OUTPUT: «ab␤»\n    say $match.from;                # OUTPUT: «0␤»\n    say $match.to;                  # OUTPUT: «2␤»\n\nOr you can evaluate the regex in boolean context, in which case it matches\nagainst the $_ variable\n\n    $_ = 'abc';\n    if / ^ab / {\n        say '\"abc\" begins with \"ab\"';\n    }\n    else {\n        say 'This is a weird alternative Universe';\n    }\n\n"},{"k":"v","t":"Sub","n":"&die"},{"n":"die","m":1,"s":{"p":[],"r":"Nil"},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"die","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["Exception:U $e"]}},{"n":"die","m":1,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":["$payload"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["|cap is raw (*@msg)"],"r":"Nil"},"n":"die","m":1},{"n":"die","m":1,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":["Failure:D $f"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"die","m":1,"s":{"p":["Failure:U $f"],"r":"Nil"}},{"n":"&infix:<=~=>","k":"v","t":"Sub"},{"s":{"p":["$?"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"infix:<=~=>","k":"s"},{"s":{"p":["\\a","\\b",":$tolerance = { ... }"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"infix:<=~=>","k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<≅>","m":1,"s":{"p":["Inf","Inf"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<≅>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["-Inf","-Inf"]}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Complex:D \\a","Complex:D \\b"]},"n":"infix:<≅>","m":1},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"infix:<≅>","s":{"p":["Complex:D \\a","Num(Real) \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"}},{"s":{"p":["Num(Real) \\a","Complex:D \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"n":"infix:<≅>","m":1,"k":"s"},{"n":"&infix:<⊎>","t":"Sub+{is-pure}+{Precedence}","k":"v"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":[]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"s":{"p":["Bag:D \\a"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["Mix:D \\a"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["MixHash:D \\a"]}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\a"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Setty:D \\a","QuantHash:D \\b"]}},{"n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Setty:D \\a","Map:D \\b"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>","s":{"p":["Mixy:D \\a","QuantHash:D \\b"],"r":"Mu"}},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Baggy:D \\a","QuantHash:D \\b"]},"n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"k":"s"},{"n":"infix:<(+)>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Map:D \\a","Map:D \\b"]},"k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Iterable:D \\a","Iterable:D \\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>","k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>","s":{"p":["$","Failure:D \\b"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Failure:D \\a","$"]}},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\a","\\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>","k":"s"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["**@p"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(+)>"},{"n":"&cosech","t":"Sub+{is-pure}","k":"v"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Numeric \\x"]},"n":"cosech","m":1,"k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Cool \\x"]},"n":"cosech","m":1,"k":"s"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"cosech","s":{"r":"num","p":["num $x"]}},{"t":"Sub","k":"v","n":"&ord"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Cool $s"]},"n":"ord","m":1},{"n":"&copy","t":"Sub","k":"v"},{"s":{"p":["$from","$to",":$createonly"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"copy","k":"s"},{"t":"Endian","k":"e","n":"NativeEndian"},{"mro":["Any","Mu"],"m":[{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Nil"},"m":0,"n":"clear"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"elems","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]}},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Mu \\value","*%_"]},"n":"push","m":0,"k":"m"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["IterationBuffer:D \\buffer","*%_"]},"n":"append","m":0,"k":"m"},{"k":"m","n":"AT-POS","m":1,"s":{"p":["int $pos","*%_"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"m","m":1,"n":"AT-POS","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Int:D $pos","*%_"]}},{"k":"m","n":"BIND-POS","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["int $pos","Mu \\value","*%_"]}},{"m":1,"n":"BIND-POS","s":{"p":["Int:D $pos","Mu \\value","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"List"}],"n":"IterationBuffer","b":"A","k":"c","t":"IterationBuffer"},{"n":"False","k":"e","t":"Bool"},{"b":"C","a":[{"n":"$!reified","k":"v","t":"Mu"},{"n":"$!todo","t":"Mu","k":"v"}],"m":[{"s":{"r":"List:D","p":["Iterator $iter","*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"from-iterator","k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"from-slurpy","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"from-slurpy-onearg","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"p":["|"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"from-slurpy-flat","m":0},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"new","s":{"r":"List:D","p":["**@things is raw","*%_"]}},{"m":0,"n":"to","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m","d":"\"abc123def\" ~~ m:g/\\d/;\n    say $/.to; # OUTPUT: «6␤»\n\nAssumes the List contains Match objects, such as the $/ variable being a\nList, when using :g modifier in regexes.

Users usually don't have to care about iterators, their usage is\nhidden behind iteration APIs such as for @list { }, map, grep, head, tail,\nskip and list indexing with .[$idx].\n\nThe main API is the pull-one method, which either returns the next value,\nor the sentinel value IterationEnd if no more elements are available. Each\nclass implementing Iterator must provide a pull-one method. All other\nnon-optional Iterator API methods are implemented in terms of pull-one, but\ncan also be overridden by consuming classes for performance or other\nreasons. There are also optional Iterator API methods that will only be\ncalled if they are implemented by the consuming class: these are not\nimplemented by the Iterator role.\n\nIterationEnd\n\nIterators only allow one iteration over the entire sequence. It's forbidden\nto make attempts to fetch more data, once IterationEnd has been generated,\nand behavior for doing so is undefined. For example, the following Seq will\nnot cause the die to be called under normal use, because pull-one will\nnever be called after it returns IterationEnd:\n\n    class SkippingArray is Array {\n        # skip all undefined values while iterating\n        method iterator {\n            class :: does Iterator {\n                has $.index is rw = 0;\n                has $.array is required;\n                method pull-one {\n                    $.index++ while !$.array.AT-POS($.index).defined && $.array.elems > $.index;\n                    $.array.elems > $.index ?? $.array.AT-POS($.index++) !!

In fact, prefix:<|> only takes a single argument, so in that\nway, it behaves closer to the .Slip method than the slip subroutine.\n\n    my $l = (1, 2, 3);\n    say (1, slip 2, 3).perl;  # says (1, 2, 3)      , slips 2, 3 into (1, …)\n    say (0, slip $l).perl;    # says (0, $(1, 2, 3)), $l does not break apart\n    say (0, $l.Slip).perl;    # says (0, 1, 2, 3)   , slips from $l into (0, …)\n    say (|$l).perl;           # says slip(1, 2, 3)  , breaks apart $l\n    say (0, (|$l, 4), 5);     # says (0 (1 2 3 4) 5), slips from $l into (…, 4)\n    say (0, ($l.Slip, 4), 5); # says (0 (1 2 3 4) 5), slips from $l into (…, 4)\n    say (0, (slip $l, 4), 5); # says (0 (1 2 3) 4 5), slips ($l, 4) into (0, …, 5)\n    say (0, ($l, 4).Slip, 5); # says (0 (1 2 3) 4 5), slips ($l, 4) into (0, …, 5)\n\n\nLoops that do not want to produce a value for an iteration use Slips,\nrather than empty Lists to do so, as do if statements that do not run their\nblocks.\n\nPlease note that prefix:<|> will also apply parameters in a slippy manner\nto a routine call.

traits\n\n    class Variable {}\n\nVariables have a wealth of compile-time information, but at runtime,\naccesses to a variable usually act on the value stored inside it, not the\nvariable itself. The runtime class of a variable is Scalar.\n\nClass Variable holds the compile-time information that traits can use to\nintrospect and manipulate variables.\n\nTraits\n\n  trait is default\n\nSets the default value with which a variable is initialized, and to which\nit is reset when Nil is assigned to it. Trait arguments are evaluated at\ncompile time. Closures won't do what you expect: they are stored as is and\nneed to be called by hand.\n\n    my Int $x is default(42);\n    say $x;     # OUTPUT: «42␤»\n    $x = 5;\n    say $x;     # OUTPUT: «5␤»\n    # explicit reset:\n    $x = Nil;\n    say $x;     # OUTPUT: «42␤»\n\nThe trait is default can be used also with subscripting things like arrays\nand hashes:\n\n    my @array is default( 'N/A' );\n    @array[22].say;  # OUTPUT: N/A\n    @array = Nil;\n    @array.say;      # OUTPUT: [N/A]\n    @array[4].say;   # OUTPUT: N/A\n\n    my %hash is default( 'no-value-here' );\n    %hash<non-existent-key>.say; # OUTPUT: no-value-here\n    %hash<foo> = 'bar';\n    %hash<>.say;                 # OUTPUT: {foo => bar}\n    %hash<wrong-key>.say;        # OUTPUT: no-value-here\n\n\n  trait is dynamic\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Variable:D, :$dynamic)\n\nMarks a variable as dynamic, that is, accessible from inner dynamic scopes\nwithout being in an inner lexical scope.\n\n    sub introspect() {\n        say $CALLER::x;\n    }\n    my $x is dynamic = 23;\n    introspect;         # OUTPUT: «23␤»\n    {\n        # not dynamic\n        my $x;\n        introspect()    # dies with an exception of type X::Caller::NotDynamic\n    }\n\n\nThe is dynamic trait is a rather cumbersome way of creating and accessing\ndynamic variables. A much easier way is to use the * twigil:\n\n    sub introspect() {\n        say $*x;\n    }\n    my $*x = 23;\n    introspect;         # OUTPUT: «23␤»\n    {\n        # not dynamic\n        my $x;\n

to $i; expected Int but got Str (\"forty plus two\")␤»\n\nYou can use any value defined in compile time as a type constraint,\nincluding constants:\n\n    constant \\T = Int;\n    my $i of T =

The first is to use a\nfactory method (start, in, at, anyof, allof, kept, broken) on the type\nobject; those will make sure that the promise is automatically kept or\nbroken for you, and you can't call break or keep on these promises\nyourself.\n\nThe second is to create your promises yourself with Promise.new. If you\nwant to ensure that only your code can keep or break the promise, you can\nuse the vow method to get a unique handle, and call keep or break on it:\n\n    sub async-get-with-promise($user-agent, $url) {\n        my $p = Promise.new;\n        my $v = $p.vow;\n\n        # do an asynchronous call on a fictive user agent,\n        # and return the promise:\n        $user-agent.async-get($url,\n                on-error => -> $error {\n                    $v.break($error);\n                },\n                on-success => -> $response {\n                    $v.keep($response);\n                }\n        );\n        return $p;\n    }\n\n\nFurther examples can be found in the concurrency page.\n\n","t":"Promise","m":[{"s":{"p":[":$scheduler = { ... }",":$report-broken-if-sunk","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"new","k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"BUILD","m":0,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":[":scheduler($!scheduler) = { ... }",":$report-broken-if-sunk","*%_"]}},{"m":0,"n":"vow","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m","d":"my class Vow {\n        has Promise $.promise;\n        method keep() { ... }\n        method break() { ... }\n    }\n    method vow(Promise:D: --> Vow:D)\n\n\nReturns an object that holds the sole authority over keeping or breaking a\npromise.

Captures\nare the flip-side of Signatures – Captures are the caller defined\narguments, while Signatures are the callee defined parameters.\n\nWhen you call print $a, $b, the $a, $b part is a Capture.\n\nCaptures contain a list-like part for positional arguments and a hash-like\npart for named arguments, thus behaving as Positional and Associative,\nalthough it does not actually mixes in those roles. For the named\narguments, Captures use a slightly different syntax than a normal List.\nThere are two easy ways to make a named argument: 1) use an unquoted key\nnaming a parameter, followed by =>, followed by the argument and 2) use a\ncolon-pair literal named after the parameter:\n\n    say unique 1, -2, 2, 3, as => { abs $_ };   # OUTPUT: «(1 -2 3)␤»\n    # ... is the same thing as:\n    say unique 1, -2, 2, 3, :as({ abs $_ });    # OUTPUT: «(1 -2 3)␤»\n    # Be careful not to quote the name of a named parameter:\n    say unique 1, -2, 2, 3, 'as' => { abs $_ };\n    # OUTPUT: «(1 -2 2 3 as => -> ;; $_? is raw { #`(Block|78857320) ... })␤»\n\nA stand-alone Capture can also be made, stored, and used later. A literal\nCapture can be created by prefixing a term with a backslash \\. Commonly,\nthis term will be a List of terms, from which any Pair literal will be\nplaced in the named part, and all other terms will be placed in the\npositional part.\n\n    my $c = \\(42);          # Capture with one positional part\n    $c = \\(1, 2, a => 'b'); # Capture with two positional and one named parts\n\nTo use such a Capture, you may use '|' before it in a function call, and it\nwill be as if the values in the Capture were passed directly to the\nfunction as arguments – named arguments will be passed as named arguments\nand positional arguments will be passed as positional arguments.

Subs are created with the sub\ndeclarator keyword followed by an optional identifier. This short tutorial\nexplains how operators are declared. For details of a sub's parameter list,\nsee Signature.\n\nNote that subs that go by the same name as coercers will not take\nprecedence over them. Use the &-sigil to call them.\n\n    sub Int(Str $s){'what?'};\n    say [Int, Int('42'),&Int('42')];\n    # OUTPUT: «[(Int) 42 what?]␤»\n\n Subs can be nested and scoped with my and our, whereby my is the default.\nA sub declared with my cannot be reached from any outer scope. An our\nscoped sub will not redefine a sub of the same name in the outer scope. Any\nsub can be accessed via a closure from any outer scope. For instance, in\nthis example\n\n    sub can-be-seener( $whatever ) {\n      my sub can-be-seen ( $objection ) {\n        return $whatever but $objection;\n      }\n      return &can-be-seen\n    }\n\n    my $objectioner = can-be-seener( \"Really?\");\n    say $objectioner(42).Int; # OUTPUT: «42␤»\n\n$objectioner will contain the can-be-seen subroutine, even if it has been\ndeclared in another scope; calling it with 42 will return \"Really?\" with\nthe number 42 mixed in, as shown in the last sentence.\n\nOperators\n\nOperators are also Subs. Their definition includes the category they belong\nto and their code, precedence and associativity. The syntax used in their\ndefinition is an example of extended identifiers.\n\nTraits \n\nA Trait is a sub that is applied at compile time to various objects like\nclasses, routines or containers. It is declared with the trait_mod\ndeclarator followed by a colon and a string literal containing the name of\nthe trait. A single positional parameter defines the type of the object\nthat the trait is applied to. A single named argument defines the secondary\nname and may carry arguments when the trait is called. Traits are a special\ngrammar category and are allowed to be placed after most language object\nnames or parameter lists.\n\n    say 'start';\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is>(Sub $s, :$foo){\n        say \"⟨is foo⟩ has been called with ⟨$foo⟩ on {$s.WHICH}\";\n    }\n    sub bar() is foo<oi‽> {\n        say 'bar has been called'\n    }\n    bar();\n    # OUTPUT: «⟨is foo⟩ has been called with ⟨oi‽⟩ on Sub|47563000␤start␤bar has been called␤»\n\nUse destructuring to call traits with complex arguments.\n\n    multi trait_mod:<is>(Variable $a, :@foo [$firstpos, *@restpos, :$named, *%restnameds]) {\n        say [$firstpos, @restpos, $named, %restnameds]\n    }\n    my $x is foo[1,2,3,:named<a>, :2b, :3c] = 1\n    # OUTPUT: «[1 [2 3] a {b => 2, c => 3}]␤»\n\nDespite its funky syntax, a trait is just a normal Sub. We can apply traits\nto it (or even themselves) and we can apply traits to objects at runtime.\n\n    multi sub trait_mod:<is> (Sub $s, :$foo) is foo {\n        say 'is foo called'\n    }\n    sub bar {}\n    &trait_mod:<is>(&bar, :foo);\n    # OUTPUT: «is foo called␤is foo called␤»","k":"c"},{"n":"byte","k":"n","t":"byte"},{"n":"&min","k":"v","t":"Sub+{is-pure}"},{"n":"min","m":1,"s":{"p":["+\\args is raw",":&by!"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"min","m":1,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["+\\args is raw"]}},{"n":"&ceiling","k":"v","t":"Sub+{is-pure}"},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["$a"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"ceiling"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Numeric $a"]},"n":"ceiling","m":1},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["num $a"],"r":"num"},"m":1,"n":"ceiling"},{"k":"ro","d":"TITLE\nclass Sequence\n\nSUBTITLE\nOperations for higher-level sequences\n\n    class Sequence does PositionalBindFailover { }\n\nA Sequence implements a series of methods for converting hight-level Seqs\ninto different types of objects, from positional to other.\n\n","t":"Sequence","mro":[],"n":"Sequence","b":"C"},{"n":"&succeed","t":"Sub","k":"v"},{"k":"s","n":"succeed","m":1,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":[]}},{"n":"succeed","m":1,"s":{"r":"Nil","p":["\\x"]},"k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"succeed","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["|"]},"k":"s"},{"t":"Sub+{Callable[Bool:D]}+{is-pure}+{Precedence}","k":"v","n":"&infix:<(elem)>"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Str:D \\a","Map:D \\b"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","n":"infix:<(elem)>","m":1,"s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","Map:D \\b"]}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["Int:D \\a","Range:D \\b"]},"n":"infix:<(elem)>","m":1},{"n":"infix:<(elem)>","m":1,"s":{"p":["\\a","Iterable:D \\b"],"r":"Bool:D"},"k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","Iterator:D \\b"]},"k":"s"},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","QuantHash:D \\b"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>","s":{"p":["$","Failure:D \\b"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Failure:D \\a","$"]},"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>","k":"s"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<(elem)>","s":{"p":["\\a","\\b"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"s"},{"n":"&postcircumfix:<{; }>","k":"v","t":"Sub+{is-nodal}"},{"k":"s","n":"postcircumfix:<{; }>","m":1,"s":{"p":["\\SELF","@indices"],"r":"Mu"}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\SELF","@indices",":$exists!"]},"m":1,"n":"postcircumfix:<{; }>"},{"k":"v","t":"Sub+{is-pure}","n":"&item"},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["\\x"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"item","m":1},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"item","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["|c is raw"]}},{"k":"s","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Mu $a"]},"n":"item","m":1},{"n":"utf8","m":[{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"encoding","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Str"}},{"k":"m","n":"!spread","m":0,"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\to","\\from","*%_"]}},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$action","$got","*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"!fail-typecheck"},{"m":0,"n":"!fail-range","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["$got","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"!push-list","s":{"p":["\\action","\\to","\\from","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\action","\\to","\\from","*%_"]},"n":"!unshift-list","m":0},{"m":0,"n":"!fail-typecheck-element","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\action","\\i","\\got","*%_"]},"k":"m"}],"mro":["Blob[uint8]","Positional[uint8]","Stringy","Any","Mu"],"b":"A","k":"c","t":"utf8","d":"TITLE\nclass utf8\n\nSUBTITLE\nMutable uint8 buffer for utf8 binary data\n\n    class utf8 does Blob[uint8] is repr('VMArray') {}\n\nA utf8 is a subtype of Blob which is specifically uint8 data for holding\nUTF-8 encoded text.\n\n    my utf8 $b = \"hello\".encode;\n    say $b[1].fmt(\"0x%X\"); # OUTPUT: «0x65␤»"},{"n":"&infix:<∋>","t":"Sub+{is-pure}+{Precedence}","k":"v"},{"m":1,"n":"infix:<∋>","s":{"r":"Bool:D","p":["\\a","\\b"]},"k":"s"},{"t":"Sub","k":"v","n":"&chdir"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"chdir","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["|c is raw"]}},{"k":"ro","t":"Dateish","d":"TITLE\nrole Dateish\n\nSUBTITLE\nObject that can be treated as a date\n\n    role Dateish { ... }\n\nBoth Date and DateTime support accessing a year, month and day-of-month, as\nwell as related functionality such as calculating the day of the week.\n\n","mro":[],"m":[{"k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"!SET-DAYCOUNT"},{"m":0,"n":"!ymd-from-daycount","s":{"r":"Nil","p":["$daycount","\\year","\\month","\\day","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"m":0,"n":"!DAYS-IN-MONTH","s":{"r":"Int:D","p":["\\year","\\month","*%_"]},"k":"m"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"!truncate-ymd","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Cool:D $unit","%parts?

(For immutable bags, see Bag instead.)\n\nObjects/values of any type are allowed as bag elements. Within a BagHash,\nitems that would compare positively with the === operator are considered\nthe same element, with the number of how many there were as its weight. But\nof course you can also easily get back the expanded list of items (without\nthe order):\n\n    my $breakfast = <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam>.BagHash;\n\n    say $breakfast.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    say $breakfast.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «bacon eggs spam␤»\n\n    say $breakfast.total;      # OUTPUT: «6␤»\n    say $breakfast.kxxv.sort;  # OUTPUT: «bacon eggs spam spam spam spam␤»\n\n\nBagHashes can be treated as object hashes using the { } postcircumfix\noperator, which returns the corresponding integer weight for keys that are\nelements of the bag, and 0 for keys that aren't. It can also be used to\nmodify weights; setting a weight to 0 automatically removes that element\nfrom the bag, and setting a weight to a positive number adds that element\nif it didn't already exist:\n\n    my $breakfast = <spam eggs spam spam bacon spam>.BagHash;\n    say $breakfast<bacon>;     # OUTPUT: «1␤»\n    say $breakfast<spam>;      # OUTPUT: «4␤»\n    say $breakfast<sausage>;   # OUTPUT: «0␤»\n\n    $breakfast<sausage> = 2;\n    $breakfast<bacon>--;\n    say $breakfast.kxxv.sort;  # OUTPUT: «eggs sausage sausage spam spam spam spam␤»\n\n\nCreating BagHash objects\n\nBagHashes can be composed using BagHash.new. Any positional parameters,\nregardless of their type, become elements of the bag:\n\n    my $n = BagHash.new: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"c\";\n    say $n.perl;             # OUTPUT: «(\"b\"=>1,\"a\"=>1,\"c\"=>2).BagHash␤»\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(\"b\", \"a\", \"c\").Seq␤»\n    say $n.values.perl;      # OUTPUT: «(1, 1, 2).Seq␤»\n\nBesides, BagHash.new-from-pairs can create a BagHash with items and their\noccurrences.\n\n    my $n = BagHash.new-from-pairs: \"a\" => 0, \"b\" => 1, \"c\" => 2, \"c\" => 2;\n    say $n.perl;             # OUTPUT: «(\"b\"=>1,\"c\"=>4).BagHash␤»\n    say $n.keys.perl;        # OUTPUT: «(\"b\", \"c\").Seq␤»\n    say $n.values.perl;      # OUTPUT: «(1, 4).Seq␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .BagHash coercer (or its functional form, BagHash()) can\nbe called on an existing object to coerce it to a BagHash. Its semantics\ndepend on the type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the\nobject in list context and creates a bag with the resulting items as\nelements, although for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys\nbecome elements of the bag, and the (cumulative) values become the\nassociated integer weights:\n\n    my $m = (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"c\").BagHash;\n    my $n = (\"a\" => 0, \"b\" => 1, \"c\" => 2, \"c\" => 2).BagHash;\n    say $m.perl;             # OUTPUT: «(\"b\"=>1,\"a\"=>1,\"c\"=>2).BagHash␤»\n    say $n.perl;             # OUTPUT: «(\"b\"=>1,\"c\"=>4).BagHash␤»\n\nYou can also create BagHash masquerading as a hash by using the is trait:\n\n    my %bh is BagHash = <a b b c c c>;\n    say %bh<b>;  # 2\n    say %bh<d>;  # 0\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) it is also possible to specify the type of\nvalues you would like to allow in a BagHash. This can either be done when\ncalling .new:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my $n = BagHash[Str].new: <a b b c c c>;\n\nor using the masquerading syntax:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my %bh is BagHash[Str] = <a b b c c c>;\n    say %bh<b>;  # 2\n    say %bh<d>;  # 0\n\n    # only allow whole numbers\n    my %bh is BagHash[Int] = <a b b c c c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\nRaku provides common set and bag operators, which can take BagHashes (or\nany other collections) as input, and return result as Bool, Set or Bag\nvalues. For example:\n\n    my ($a, $b) = BagHash.new(2, 2, 4), BagHash.new(2, 3, 3, 4);\n\n    say $a (<) $b;   # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (<+) $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (^) $b;   # OUTPUT: «Bag(3(2), 2)␤»\n    say $a (+) $b;   # OUTPUT: «Bag(2(3), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n    # Unicode versions:\n    say $a ⊂ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ≼ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ⊖ $b;  # OUTPUT: «Bag(3(2), 2)␤»\n    say $a ⊎ $b;  # OUTPUT: «Bag(2(3), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set and bag operators with\ndetailed explanations.\n\nNote on reverse and ordering.\n\nBagHash inherits reverse from Any, however, Bags do not have an inherent\norder and you should not trust it returning a consistent output.\n\nIf you sort a BagHash, the result is a list of pairs, at which point\nreverse makes perfect sense:\n\n    my $a = BagHash.new(2, 2, 18, 3, 4);\n    say $a;  # OUTPUT: «BagHash(18, 2(2), 3, 4)␤»\n\n    say $a.sort;  # OUTPUT: «(2 => 2 3 => 1 4 => 1 18 => 1)␤»\n    say $a.sort.reverse;  # OUTPUT: «(18 => 1 4 => 1 3 => 1 2 => 2)␤»\n\n\nSee Also\n\nSets, Bags, and Mixes","n":"BagHash","m":[{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"total"},{"s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"clone","k":"m"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\type","*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"!HASHIFY"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"!create-from-iterator","s":{"p":["\\type","\\iterator","*%_"],"r":"Baggy:D"}}],"mro":["Baggy","QuantHash","Associative","Any","Mu"],"b":"A","a":[{"k":"v","t":"Rakudo::Internals::IterationSet","n":"$!elems"}]},{"k":"v","t":"Sub","n":"&msb"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"msb","s":{"r":"Int:D","p":["Int:D \\i"]}},{"n":"&unival","k":"v","t":"Sub"},{"k":"s","m":1,"n":"unival","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["Str:D $str"]}},{"k":"s","s":{"p":["Int:D $code"],"r":"Mu"},"m":1,"n":"unival"},{"t":"ProtocolType","k":"e","n":"PROTO_TCP"},{"b":"A","a":[{"n":"$!parts","t":"Mu","k":"v"},{"k":"v","t":"int","n":"$!plus"},{"n":"$!whatever","t":"int","k":"v"},{"n":"$!string","k":"v","t":"str"}],"m":[{"m":0,"n":"Capture","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"k":"m","d":"Defined as:\n\n    method Capture()\n\nThrows X::Cannot::Capture."},{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"parts","d":"method parts(Version:D: --> List:D)\n\nReturns the list of parts that make up this Version object\n\n    my $v1 = v1.0.1;\n    my $v2 = v1.0.1+;\n    say $v1.parts;                                    # OUTPUT: «(1 0 1)␤»\n    say $v2.parts;                                    # OUTPUT: «(1 0 1)␤»\n\nThe + suffix is not considered a part of the Version object, and thus not\nreturned by this method, as shown above in the $v2 variable.","k":"m"},{"d":"method plus(Version:D: --> Bool:D)\n\nReturns True if comparisons against this version allow larger versions\ntoo.\n\n    my $v1 = v1.0.1;\n    my $v2 = v1.0.1+;\n    say $v1.plus;                                     # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $v2.plus;                                     # OUTPUT: «True␤»","k":"m","s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"plus"},{"k":"m","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["*%_"]},"m":0,"n":"whatever"},{"k":"m","m":0,"n":"!SET-SELF","s":{"r":"Mu","p":["\\parts","\\plus","\\whatever","\\string","*%_"]}},{"s":{"p":["str $s","*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"m":0,"n":"!SLOW-NEW","k":"m"}],"mro":["Any","Mu"],"n":"Version","t":"Version","d":"TITLE\nclass Version\n\nSUBTITLE\nModule version descriptor\n\n    class Version { }\n\nVersion objects identify version of software components (and potentially\nother entities).

In the following cases, * will remain a\nWhatever object.\n\n  Exception        Example  What it does\n  comma            1, *, 2  generates a List with a * element\n  range operators  1 .. *   Range.new(:from(1), :to(*));\n  series operator  1 ... *  infinite list\n  assignment       $x = *   assign * to $x\n  binding          $x := *  bind * to $x\n  list repetition  1 xx *   generates an infinite list\n\n\nThe range operators are handled specially.

(For\nimmutable mixes, see Mix instead.)\n\nObjects/values of any type are allowed as mix elements. Within a MixHash,\nitems that would compare positively with the === operator are considered\nthe same element, with a combined weight.\n\n    my $recipe = (butter => 0.22, sugar => 0.1,\n                  flour => 0.275, sugar => 0.02).MixHash;\n\n    say $recipe.elems;      # OUTPUT: «3␤»\n    say $recipe.keys.sort;  # OUTPUT: «butter flour sugar␤»\n    say $recipe.pairs.sort; # OUTPUT: «\"butter\" => 0.22 \"flour\" => 0.275 \"sugar\" => 0.12␤»\n    say $recipe.total;      # OUTPUT: «0.615␤»\n\n\nMixHashes can be treated as object hashes using the { } postcircumfix\noperator, which returns the corresponding numeric weight for keys that are\nelements of the mix, and 0 for keys that aren't. It can also be used to\nmodify weights; Setting a weight to 0 automatically removes that element\nfrom the mix, and setting a weight to a non-zero number adds that element\nif it didn't already exist:\n\n    my $recipe = (butter => 0.22, sugar => 0.1,\n                  flour => 0.275, sugar => 0.02).MixHash;\n\n    say $recipe<butter>;     # OUTPUT: «0.22␤»\n    say $recipe<sugar>;      # OUTPUT: «0.12␤»\n    say $recipe<chocolate>;  # OUTPUT: «0␤»\n\n    $recipe<butter> = 0;\n    $recipe<chocolate> = 0.30;\n    say $recipe.pairs;       # OUTPUT: «\"sugar\" => 0.12 \"flour\" => 0.275 \"chocolate\" => 0.3␤»\n\n\nCreating MixHash objects\n\nMixHashes can be composed using MixHash.new. Any positional parameters,\nregardless of their type, become elements of the mix - with a weight of 1\nfor each time the parameter occurred:\n\n    my $n = MixHash.new: \"a\", \"a\", \"b\" => 0, \"c\" => 3.14;\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Pair) (Pair))␤»\n    say $n.pairs;            # OUTPUT: «(a => 2 (c => 3.14) => 1 (b => 0) => 1)␤»\n\nAlternatively, the .MixHash coercer (or its functional form, MixHash()) can\nbe called on an existing object to coerce it to a MixHash. Its semantics\ndepend on the type and contents of the object. In general it evaluates the\nobject in list context and creates a mix with the resulting items as\nelements, although for Hash-like objects or Pair items, only the keys\nbecome elements of the mix, and the (cumulative) values become the\nassociated numeric weights:\n\n    my $n = (\"a\", \"a\", \"b\" => 0, \"c\" => 3.14).MixHash;\n    say $n.keys.map(&WHAT);  # OUTPUT: «((Str) (Str))␤»\n    say $n.pairs;            # OUTPUT: «(a => 2 c => 3.14)␤»\n\nSince 6.d (2019.03 and later) it is also possible to specify the type of\nvalues you would like to allow in a MixHash. This can either be done when\ncalling .new:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my $n = MixHash[Str].new: <a b b c c c>;\n\nor using the masquerading syntax:\n\n    # only allow strings\n    my %mh is MixHash[Str] = <a b b c c c>;\n    say %mh<b>;  # 2\n    say %mh<d>;  # 0\n\n    # only allow whole numbers\n    my %mh is MixHash[Int] = <a b b c c c>;\n    # Type check failed in binding; expected Int but got Str (\"a\")\n\nOperators\n\n    my ($a, $b) = MixHash(2 => 2, 4), MixHash(2 => 1.5, 3 => 2, 4);\n\n    say $a (<) $b;   # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (<+) $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a (^) $b;   # OUTPUT: «Mix(2(0.5), 3(2))␤»\n    say $a (+) $b;   # OUTPUT: «Mix(2(3.5), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n    # Unicode versions:\n    say $a ⊂ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ≼ $b;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $a ⊖ $b;  # OUTPUT: «Mix(2(0.5), 3(2))␤»\n    say $a ⊎ $b;  # OUTPUT: «Mix(2(3.5), 4(2), 3(2))␤»\n\n\nSee Set/Bag Operators for a complete list of set and bag operators with\ndetailed explanations.\n\nNote on reverse and ordering.\n\nMixHash inherits reverse from Any, however, Mixes do not have an inherent\norder and you should not trust it returning a consistent output.\n\nIf you sort a MixHash, the result is a list of pairs, at which point\nreverse makes perfect sense:\n\n    my $a = MixHash.new(2, 2, 18, 3, 4);\n    say $a;  # OUTPUT: «MixHash(18, 2(2), 3, 4)␤»\n\n    say $a.sort;  # OUTPUT: «(2 => 2 3 => 1 4 => 1 18 => 1)␤»\n    say $a.sort.reverse;  # OUTPUT: «(18 => 1 4 => 1 3 => 1 2 =>

The semantics of this collapse depend on the junction\ntype, which can be all, any, one or none.\n\n  type  constructor  operator  True if ...\n  all   all          &         no value evaluates to False\n  any   any          |         at least one value evaluates to True\n  one   one          ^         exactly one value evaluates to True\n  none  none                   no value evaluates to True\n\n\nAs the table shows, in order to create junctions, you use the string that\nrepresents the type followed by any object, or else call .all, .none or\n.one on the object.\n\n    say so 3 == (1..30).one;         # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say so (\"a\" ^ \"b\" ^ \"c\") eq \"a\"; # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nJunctions are very special objects. They fall outside the Any hierarchy,\nbeing only, as any other object, subclasses of Mu. That enables a feature\nfor most methods: autothreading. Autothreading happens when a junction is\nbound to a parameter of a code object that doesn't accept values of type\nJunction. Instead of producing an error, the signature binding is repeated\nfor each value of the junction.\n\nExample:\n\n    my $j = 1|2;\n    if 3 == $j + 1 {\n        say 'yes';\n    }\n\nFirst autothreads over the infix:<+>  operator, producing the Junction 2|3.\nThe next autothreading step is over infix:<==> , which produces False|True.\nThe if conditional evaluates the junction in boolean context, which\ncollapses it to True. So the code prints yes\\n.\n\nThe type of a Junction does not affect the number of items in the resultant\nJunction after autothreading. For example, using a one Junction during Hash\nkey lookup, still results in a Junction with several items. It is only in\nboolean context would the type of the Junction come into play:\n\n    my %h = :42foo, :70bar;\n    say    %h{one <foo meow>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «one(True, False)␤»\n    say so %h{one <foo meow>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say    %h{one <foo  bar>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «one(True, True)␤»\n    say so %h{one <foo  bar>}:exists; # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nNote that the compiler is allowed, but not required, to parallelize\nautothreading (and Junction behavior in general), so it is usually an error\nto autothread junctions over code with side effects.\n\nAutothreading implies that the function that's autothreaded will also\nreturn a Junction of the values that it would usually return.\n\n    (1..3).head( 2|3 ).say; # OUTPUT: «any((1 2), (1 2 3))␤»\n\nSince .head returns a list, the autothreaded version returns a Junction of\nlists.\n\n    (1..3).contains( 2&3 ).say; # OUTPUT: «all(True, True)␤»\n\nLikewise, .contains returns a Boolean; thus, the autothreaded version\nreturns a Junction of Booleans. In general, all methods and routines that\ntake an argument of type T and return type TT, will also accept junctions\nof T, returning junctions of TT.\n\nImplementations are allowed to short-circuit Junctions. For example one or\nmore routine calls (a(), b(), or c()) in the code below might not get\nexecuted at all, if the result of the conditional has been fully determined\nfrom routine calls already performed (only one truthy return value is\nenough to know the entire Junction is true):\n\n    if a() | b() | c() {\n        say \"At least one of the routines was called and returned a truthy value\"\n    }\n\n\nJunctions are meant to be used as matchers in boolean context;\nintrospection of junctions is not supported. If you feel the urge to\nintrospect a junction, use a Set or a related type instead.\n\nUsage examples:\n\n    my @list = <1 2 \"Great\">;\n    @list.append(True).append(False);\n    my @bool_or_int = grep Bool|Int, @list;\n\n    sub is_prime(Int $x) returns Bool {\n        # 'so' is for boolean context\n        so $x %% none(2..$x.sqrt);\n    }\n    my @primes_ending_in_1 = grep &is_prime & / 1$ /, 2..100;\n    say @primes_ending_in_1;        # OUTPUT: «[11 31 41 61 71]␤»\n\n    my @exclude = <~ .git>;\n    for dir(\".\") { say .Str if .Str.ends-with(none @exclude) }\n\nSpecial care should be taken when using all with arguments that may produce\nan empty list:\n\n    my @a = ();\n    say so all(@a) # True, because there are 0 False's\n\nTo express \"all, but at least one\", you can use @a && all(@a)\n\n    my @a = ();\n    say so @a && all(@a);   # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nNegated operators are special-cased when it comes to autothreading. $a !op\n$b is rewritten internally as !($a op $b). The outer negation collapses any\njunctions, so the return value always a plain Bool.\n\n    my $word = 'yes';\n    my @negations = <no none never>;\n    if $word !eq any @negations {\n        say '\"yes\" is not a negation';\n    }\n\nNote that without this special-casing, an expression like $word ne any\n@words would always evaluate to True for non-trivial lists on one side.\n\nFor this purpose, infix:<ne>  counts as a negation of infix:<eq> .\n\nIn general it is more readable to use a positive comparison operator and a\nnegated junction:\n\n    my $word = 'yes';\n    my @negations = <no none never>;\n    if $word eq none @negations {\n        say '\"yes\" is not a negation';\n    }\n\nFailures and exceptions\n\nFailures are just values like any other, as far as Junctions are\nconcerned:\n\n    my $j = +any \"not a number\", \"42\", \"2.1\";\n    my @list = gather for $j -> $e {\n        take $e if $e.defined;\n    }\n    @list.say; # OUTPUT: «[42 2.1]␤»\n\nAbove, we've used prefix + operator on a Junction to coerce the strings\ninside of it to Numeric. Since the operator returns a Failure when a Str\nthat doesn't contain a number gets coerced to Numeric, one of the elements\nin the Junction is a Failure. Failures do not turn into exceptions until\nthey are used or sunk, but we can check for definedness to avoid that. That\nis what we do in the loop that runs over the elements of the junction,\nadding them to a list only if they are defined.\n\nThe exception will be thrown, if you try to use the Failure as a value—just\nlike as if this Failure were on its own and not part of the Junction:\n\n    my $j = +any \"not a number\", \"42\", \"2.1\";\n    try say $j == 42;\n    $! and say \"Got exception: $!.^name()\";\n    # OUTPUT: «Got exception: X::Str::Numeric␤»\n\n\nNote that if an exception gets thrown when any of the values in a Junction\nget computed, it will be thrown just as if the problematic value were\ncomputed on its own and not with a Junction; you can't just compute the\nvalues that work while ignoring exceptions:\n\n    sub calc ($_) { die when 13 }\n    my $j = any 1..42;\n    say try calc $j; # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n\nOnly one value above causes an exception, but the result of the try block\nis still a Nil. A possible way around it is to cheat and evaluate the\nvalues of the Junction individually and then re-create the Junction from\nthe result:\n\n    sub calc ($_) { die when 13 }\n    my $j = any 1..42;\n    $j = any (gather $j».take).grep: {Nil !=== try calc $_};\n    say so $j == 42; # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nSmartmatching\n\nNote that using Junctions on the right-hand side of ~~ works slightly\ndifferently than using Junctions with other operators.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n    say 25 == (25 | 42);    # OUTPUT: «any(True, False)␤» – Junction\n    say 25 ~~ (25 | 42);    # OUTPUT: «True␤»             – Bool\n\nThe reason is that == (and most other operators) are subject to\nauto-threading, and therefore you will get a Junction as a result. On the\nother hand, ~~ will call .ACCEPTS on the right-hand-side (in this case on a\nJunction) and the result will be a Bool.\n\n"},{"n":"&uniprops","t":"Sub","k":"v"},{"s":{"p":["Str:D

method. The invocant is the object that was\nused to call the method, which is usually bound to self. By specifying it\nin the signature, you can change the variable name it is bound to.\n\n    method ($a: @b, %c) {};       # first argument is the invocant\n\n    class Foo {\n        method whoami($me:) {\n            \"Well I'm class $me.^name(), of course!\"\n        }\n    }\n    say Foo.whoami; # OUTPUT: «Well I'm class Foo, of course!␤»\n\n \n\n  Type constraints\n\nParameters can optionally have a type constraint (the default is Any).\nThese can be used to restrict the allowed input to a function.\n\n    my $sig = :(Int $a, Str $b);\n\n\nType constraints can have any compile-time defined value\n\n    subset Positive-integer of Int where * > 0;\n    sub divisors(Positive-integer $n) { $_ if $n %% $_ for 1..$n };\n    divisors 2.5;\n    # ERROR «Type check failed in binding to parameter '$n';\n    # expected Positive-integer but got Rat (2.5) $n)»\n    divisors -3;\n    # ERROR: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$n';\n    # expected Positive-integer but got Int (-3)»\n\n\nPlease note that in the code above type constraints are enforced at two\ndifferent levels: the first level checks if it belongs to the type in which\nthe subset is based, in this case Int. If it fails, a Type check error is\nproduced. Once that filter is cleared, the constraint that defined the\nsubset is checked, producing a Constraint type check error if it fails.\n\n Anonymous arguments are fine too, if you don't actually need to refer to a\nparameter by name, for instance to distinguish between different signatures\nin a multi or to check the signature of a Callable.\n\n    my $sig = :($, @, %a);          # two anonymous and a \"normal\" parameter\n    $sig = :(Int, Positional);      # just a type is also fine (two parameters)\n    sub baz(Str) { \"Got passed a Str\" }\n\nType constraints may also be type captures.\n\n In addition to those nominal types, additional constraints can be placed\non parameters in the form of code blocks which must return a true value to\npass the type check\n\n    sub f(Real $x where { $x > 0 }, Real $y where { $y >= $x }) { }\n\nThe code in where clauses has some limitations: anything that produces\nside-effects (e.g., printing output, pulling from an iterator, or\nincreasing a state variable) is not supported and may produce surprising\nresults if used. Also, the code of the where clause may run more than once\nfor a single typecheck in some implementations.\n\nThe where clause doesn't need to be a code block, anything on the right of\nthe where-clause will be used to smartmatch the argument against it. So you\ncan also write:\n\n    multi factorial(Int $ where 0) { 1 }\n    multi factorial(Int $x)        { $x * factorial($x - 1) }\n\nThe first of those can be shortened to\n\n    multi factorial(0) { 1 }\n\ni.e., you can use a literal directly as a type and value constraint on an\nanonymous parameter.\n\nTip: pay attention to not accidentally leave off a block when you, say,\nhave several conditions:\n\n    -> $y where   .so && .name    {}( sub one   {} ); # WRONG!!\n    -> $y where { .so && .name }  {}( sub two   {} ); # OK!\n    -> $y where   .so &  .name.so {}( sub three {} ); # Also good\n\nThe first version is wrong and will issue a warning about a sub object\ncoerced to string. The reason is the expression is equivalent to ($y ~~\n($y.so && $y.name)); that is \"call .so, and if that is True, call .name; if\nthat is also True use its value for smartmatching…\". It's the result of\n(.so && .name) it will be smartmatched against, but we want to check that\nboth .so and .name are truthy values. That is why an explicit Block or a\nJunction is the right version.\n\nAll previous arguments that are not part of a sub-signature in a Signature\nare accessible in a where-clause that follows an argument. Therefore, the\nwhere-clause of the last argument has access to all arguments of a\nsignature that are not part of a sub-signature. For a sub-signature place\nthe where-clause inside the sub-signature.\n\n    sub foo($a, $b where * == $a ** 2) { say \"$b is a square of $a\" }\n    foo 2, 4; # OUTPUT: «4 is a square of 2␤»»\n    # foo 2, 3;\n    # OUTPUT: «Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '$b'…»\n\n    Constraining optional arguments\n\nOptional arguments can have constraints, too. Any where clause on any\nparameter will be executed, even if it's optional and not provided by the\ncaller. In that case you may have to guard against undefined values within\nthe where clause.\n\n    sub f(Int $a, UInt $i? where { !$i.defined or $i > 5 }) { ... }\n\n    Constraining slurpy arguments\n\nSlurpy arguments can not have type constraints. A where-clause in\nconjunction with a Junction can be used to that effect.\n\n    sub f(*@a where {$_.all ~~ Int}) { say @a };\n    f(42);\n    f(<a>);\n    CATCH { default { say .^name, ' ==> ', .Str }  }\n    # OUTPUT: «[42]␤Constraint type check failed in binding to parameter '@a' ...»\n\n\n    Constraining named arguments\n\nConstraints against Named arguments apply to the value part of the\ncolon-pair.\n\n    sub f(Int :$i){};\n    f :i<forty-two>;\n    CATCH { default { say .^name, ' ==> ', .Str }  }\n    # OUTPUT: «X::TypeCheck::Binding::Parameter ==> Type check failed in\n    # binding to parameter '$i'; expected Int but got Str (\"forty-two\")␤»\n\n  \n\n    Constraining argument definiteness\n\nNormally, a type constraint only checks whether the value of the parameter\nis of the correct type. Crucially, both object instances and type objects\nwill satisfy such a constraint as illustrated below:\n\n    say  42.^name;    # OUTPUT: «Int␤»\n    say  42 ~~ Int;   # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say Int ~~ Int;   # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nNote how both 42 and Int satisfy the match.\n\nSometimes we need to distinguish between these object instances (42) and\ntype objects (Int). Consider the following code:\n\n    sub limit-lines(Str $s, Int $limit) {\n        my @lines = $s.lines;\n        @lines[0 .. min @lines.elems, $limit].join(\"\\n\")\n    }\n    say (limit-lines \"a \\n b \\n c \\n d \\n\", 3).perl; # \"a \\n b \\n c \\n d \"\n    say limit-lines Str, 3;\n    CATCH { default { put .^name, ': ', .Str } };\n    # OUTPUT: «X::Multi::NoMatch: Cannot resolve caller lines(Str: );\n    # none of these signatures match:\n    #     (Str:D $: :$count!, *%_)\n    #     (Str:D $: $limit, *%_)\n    #     (Str:D $: *%_)»\n    say limit-lines \"a \\n b\", Int; # Always returns the max number of lines\n\nHere we really only want to deal with string instances, not type objects.\nTo do this, we can use the :D type constraint. This constraint checks that\nthe value passed is an object instance, in a similar fashion to calling its\nDEFINITE (meta)method.\n\nTo warm up, let's apply :D to the right-hand side of our humble Int\nexample:\n\n    say  42 ~~ Int:D;  # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say Int ~~ Int:D;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nNote how only 42 matches Int:D in the above.\n\nReturning to limit-lines, we can now amend its signature to catch the error\nearly:\n\n    sub limit-lines(Str:D $s, Int $limit) { };\n    say limit-lines Str, 3;\n    CATCH { default { put .^name ~ '--' ~ .Str } };\n    # OUTPUT: «Parameter '$s' of routine 'limit-lines' must be an object instance of type 'Str',\n    #          not a type object of type 'Str'.  Did you forget a '.new'?»\n\nThis is much better than the way the program failed before, since here the\nreason for failure is clearer.\n\nIt's also possible that type objects are the only ones that make sense for\na routine to accept. This can be done with the :U type constraint, which\nchecks whether the value passed is a type object rather than an object\ninstance. Here's our Int example again, this time with :U applied:\n\n    say  42 ~~ Int:U;  # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say Int ~~ Int:U;  # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nNow 42 fails to match Int:U while Int succeeds.\n\nHere's a more practical example:\n\n    sub can-turn-into(Str $string, Any:U $type) {\n       return so $string.$type;\n    }\n    say can-turn-into(\"3\", Int);        # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say can-turn-into(\"6.5\", Int);      # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say can-turn-into(\"6.5\", Num);      # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say can-turn-into(\"a string\", Num); # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n\nCalling can-turn-into with an object instance as its second parameter will\nyield a constraint violation as intended:\n\n    say can-turn-into(\"a string\", 123);\n    # OUTPUT: «Parameter '$type' of routine 'can-turn-into' must be a type object\n    # of type 'Any', not an object instance of type 'Int'...»\n\n\nFor explicitly indicating the normal behavior, that is, not constraining\nwhether the argument will be an instance or a type object, :_ can be used,\nbut this is unnecessary. :(Num:_ $) is the same as :(Num $).\n\nTo recap, here is a quick illustration of these type constraints, also\nknown collectively as type smileys:\n\n    # Checking a type object\n    say Int ~~ Any:D;    # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say Int ~~ Any:U;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say Int ~~ Any:_;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\n    # Checking an object instance\n    say 42 ~~ Any:D;     # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say 42 ~~ Any:U;     # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say 42 ~~ Any:_;     # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\n    # Checking a user-supplied class\n    class Foo {};\n    say Foo ~~ Any:D;    # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say Foo ~~ Any:U;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say Foo ~~ Any:_;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\n    # Checking an instance of a class\n    my $f = Foo.new;\n    say $f  ~~ Any:D;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n    say $f  ~~ Any:U;    # OUTPUT: «False␤»\n    say $f  ~~ Any:_;    # OUTPUT: «True␤»\n\nThe Classes and Objects document further elaborates on the concepts of\ninstances and type objects and discovering them with the .DEFINITE method.\n\nKeep in mind all parameters have values; even optional ones have default\nvalues that are the type object of the constrained type for explicit type\nconstraints. If no explicit type constraint exists, the default value is an\nAny type object for methods, submethods, and subroutines, and a Mu type\nobject for blocks. This means that if you use the :D type smiley, you'd\nneed to provide a default value or make the parameter required. Otherwise,\nthe default value would be a type object, which would fail the definiteness\nconstraint.\n\n    sub divide (Int:D :$a = 2, Int:D :$b!) { say $a/$b }\n    divide :1a, :2b; # OUTPUT: «0.5␤»\n\nThe default value will kick in when that particular parameter, either\npositional or named, gets no value at all.\n\n    sub f($a = 42){\n      my $b is default('answer');\n      say $a;\n      $b = $a;\n      say $b\n    };\n    f;     # OUTPUT: «42␤42␤»\n    f Nil; # OUTPUT: «Nil␤answer␤»\n\n$a has 42 as its default value. With no value, $a will be assigned the\ndefault value declared in the Signature. However, in the second case, it\ndoes receive a value, which happens to be Nil. Assigning Nil to any\nvariable resets it to its default value, which has been declared as\n'answer' by use of the default trait. That explains what happens the second\ntime we call f. Routine parameters and variables deal differently with\ndefault value, which is in part clarified by the different way default\nvalues are declared in each case (using = for parameters, using the default\ntrait for variables).\n\nNote: in 6.c language, the default value of :U/:D constrained variables was\na type object with such a constraint, which is not initializable, thus you\ncannot use the .= operator, for example.\n\n    use v6.c;\n    my Int:D $x .= new: 42;\n    # OUTPUT: You cannot create an instance of this type (Int:D)\n    # in block <unit> at -e line 1\n\n\nIn the 6.d language, the default default is the type object without the\nsmiley constraint:\n\n    use v6.d;\n    my Int:D $x .= new: 42; # OUTPUT: «42␤»\n\n\nA closing remark on terminology: this section is about the use of the type\nsmileys :D and :U to constrain the definiteness of arguments. Occasionally\ndefinedness is used as a synonym for definiteness; this may be confusing,\nsince the terms have subtly different meanings.\n\nAs explained above, definiteness is concerned with the distinction between\ntype objects and object instances. A type object is always indefinite,\nwhile an object instance is always definite. Whether an object is a type\nobject/indefinite or an object instance/definite can be verified using the\nDEFINITE (meta)method.\n\nDefiniteness should be distinguished from definedness, which is concerned\nwith the difference between defined and undefined objects. Whether an\nobject is defined or undefined can be verified using the defined-method,\nwhich is implemented in class Mu. By default a type object is considered\nundefined, while an object instance is considered defined; that is:\n.defined returns False on a type object, and True otherwise. But this\ndefault behavior may be overridden by subclasses. An example of a subclass\nthat overrides the default .defined behavior is Failure, so that even an\ninstantiated Failure acts as an undefined value:\n\n    my $a = Failure;                # Initialize with type object\n    my $b = Failure.new(\"foo\");     # Initialize with object instance\n    say $a.DEFINITE;                # Output: «False␤» : indefinite type object\n    say $b.DEFINITE;                # Output: «True␤»  : definite object instance\n    say $a.defined;                 # Output: «False␤» : default response\n    say $b.defined;                 # Output: «False␤» : .defined override\n\n    Constraining signatures of Callables\n\nThe signature of a Callable parameter can be constrained by specifying a\nSignature literal right after the parameter (no whitespace allowed):\n\n    sub f(&c:(Int, Str))  { say c(10, 'ten') };\n    sub g(Int $i, Str $s) { $s ~ $i };\n    f(&g);\n    # OUTPUT: «ten10␤»\n\nThis shorthand syntax is available only for parameters with the & sigil.\nFor others, you need to use the long version:\n\n    sub f($c where .signature ~~ :(Int, Str))  { say $c(10, 'ten') }\n    sub g(Num $i, Str $s) { $s ~ $i }\n    sub h(Int $i, Str $s) { $s ~ $i }\n    # f(&g); # Constraint type check failed\n    f(&h);   # OUTPUT: «ten10␤»\n\n    Constraining return types\n\nThere are multiple ways to constrain return types on a Routine. All\nversions below are currently valid and will force a type check on\nsuccessful execution of a routine.\n\nNil and Failure are always allowed as return types, regardless of any type\nconstraint. This allows Failure to be returned and passed on down the call\nchain.\n\n    sub foo(--> Int) { Nil };\n    say foo.perl; # OUTPUT: «Nil␤»\n\nType captures are not supported.\n\n \n\n    Return type arrow: -->\n\nThis form of indicating return types (or constants) in the signature is\npreferred, since it can handle constant values while the others can't. For\nconsistency, it is the only form accepted on this site.\n\nThe return type arrow has to be placed at the end of the parameter list,\nwith or without a , before it.\n\n    sub greeting1(Str $name  --> Str) { say \"Hello, $name\" } # Valid\n    sub greeting2(Str $name, --> Str) { say \"Hello, $name\" } # Valid\n\n    sub favorite-number1(--> 42) {        } # OUTPUT: 42\n    sub favorite-number2(--> 42) { return } # OUTPUT: 42\n\n\nIf the type constraint is a constant expression, it is used as the return\nvalue of the routine. Any return statement in that routine has to be\nargumentless.\n\n    sub foo(Str $word --> 123) { say $word; return; }\n    my $value = foo(\"hello\"); # OUTPUT: hello\n    say $value;               # OUTPUT: 123\n\n\n    # The code below will not compile\n    sub foo(Str $word --> 123) { say $word; return $word; }\n    my $value = foo(\"hello\");\n    say $value;\n\n\n    returns\n\nThe keyword returns following a signature declaration has the same function\nas --> with the caveat that this form does not work with constant values.\nYou cannot use it in a block either. That is why the pointy arrow form is\nalways preferred.\n\n    sub greeting(Str $name) returns Str { say \"Hello, $name\" } # Valid\n\n\n    sub favorite-number returns 42 {        } # This will fail.\n\n\n    of\n\nof is just the real name of the returns keyword.\n\n    sub foo() of Int { 42 }; # Valid\n\n\n    sub foo() of 42 {  };    # This will fail.\n\n\n    prefix(C-like) form\n\nThis is similar to placing type constraints on variables like my Type $var\n= 20;, except the $var is a definition for a routine.\n\n    my Int sub bar { 1 };     # Valid\n\n\n    my 42 sub bad-answer {};  # This will fail.\n\n\n    Coercion type\n\nTo accept one type but coerce it automatically to another, use the accepted\ntype as an argument to the target type. If the accepted type is Any it can\nbe omitted.\n\n    sub f(Int(Str) $want-int, Str() $want-str) {\n        say $want-int.^name ~ ' ' ~ $want-str.^name\n    }\n    f '10', 10;\n    # OUTPUT: «Int Str␤»\n\n    use MONKEY;\n    augment class Str { method Date() { Date.new(self) } };\n    sub foo(Date(Str) $d) { say $d.^name; say $d };\n    foo \"2016-12-01\";\n    # OUTPUT: «Date␤2016-12-01␤»\n\nThe coercion is performed by calling the method with the name of the type\nto coerce to, if it exists (e.g. Foo(Bar) coercer, would call method Foo).\nThe method is assumed to return the correct type—no additional checks on\nthe result are currently performed.\n\nCoercion can also be performed on return types:\n\n    sub square-str (Int $x --> Str(Int)) {\n        $x²\n    }\n\n    for 2,4, *²  … 256 -> $a {\n        say $a, \"² is \", square-str( $a ).chars, \" figures long\";\n    }\n\n    # OUTPUT: «2² is 1 figures long␤\n    #          4² is 2 figures long␤\n    #          16² is 3 figures long␤\n    #          256² is 5 figures long␤»\n\n\nIn this example, coercing the return type to String allows us to directly\napply string methods, such as the number of characters.\n\n  \n\n  Slurpy (A.K.A. variadic) parameters\n\nA function is variadic if it can take a varying number of arguments; that\nis, its arity is not fixed. Therefore, optional, named, and slurpy\nparameters are variadic. An array or hash parameter can be marked as slurpy\nby leading single (*) or double asterisk (**) or a leading plus (+). A\nslurpy parameter can bind to an arbitrary number of arguments (zero or\nmore), and it will result in a type that is compatible with the sigil.\n\nThese are called \"slurpy\" because they slurp up any remaining arguments to\na function, like someone slurping up noodles.\n\n    $ = :($a, @b);  # exactly two arguments, where the second one must be Positional\n    $ = :($a, *@b); # at least one argument, @b slurps up any beyond that\n    $ = :(*%h);     # no positional arguments, but any number of named arguments\n\n    sub one-arg (@)  { }\n    sub slurpy  (*@) { }\n    one-arg (5, 6, 7); # ok, same as one-arg((5, 6, 7))\n    slurpy  (5, 6, 7); # ok\n    slurpy   5, 6, 7 ; # ok\n    # one-arg(5, 6, 7) ; # X::TypeCheck::Argument\n    # one-arg  5, 6, 7 ; # X::TypeCheck::Argument\n\n    sub named-names (*%named-args) { %named-args.keys };\n    say named-names :foo(42) :bar<baz>; # OUTPUT: «foo bar␤»\n\n\nPositional and named slurpies can be combined; named arguments (i.e.,\nPairs) are collected in the specified hash, positional arguments in the\narray:\n\n    sub combined-slurpy (*@a, *%h) { { array => @a, hash => %h } }\n    # or: sub combined-slurpy (*%h, *@a) { ... }\n\n    say combined-slurpy(one => 1, two => 2);\n    # OUTPUT: «{array => [], hash => {one => 1, two => 2}}␤»\n    say combined-slurpy(one => 1, two => 2, 3, 4);\n    # OUTPUT: «{array => [3 4], hash => {one => 1, two => 2}}␤»\n    say combined-slurpy(one => 1, two => 2, 3, 4, five => 5);\n    # OUTPUT: «{array => [3 4], hash => {five => 5, one => 1, two => 2}}␤»\n    say combined-slurpy(one => 1, two => 2, 3, 4, five => 5, 6);\n    # OUTPUT: «{array => [3 4 6], hash => {five => 5, one => 1, two => 2}}␤»\n\n\nNote that positional parameters aren't allowed after slurpy parameters:\n\n    :(*@args, $last);\n    # ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling:\n    # Cannot put required parameter $last after variadic parameters\n\n\nNormally a slurpy parameter will create an Array (or compatible type),\ncreate a new Scalar container for each argument, and assign the value from\neach argument to those Scalars. If the original argument also had an\nintermediary Scalar it is bypassed during this process, and is not\navailable inside the called function.\n\nSigiled parameters will always impose a context on the collected arguments.\nSigilless parameters can also be used slurpily, preceded by a + sign, to\nwork with whatever initial type they started with:\n\n    sub zipi( +zape ) {\n        zape.^name => zape\n    };\n    say zipi( \"Hey \"); # OUTPUT: «List => (Hey )␤»\n    say zipi( 1...* ); # OUTPUT: «Seq => (...)␤»\n\n\nSlurpy parameters have special behaviors when combined with some traits and\nmodifiers, as described in the section on slurpy array parameters.\n\n  Types of slurpy array parameters\n\nThere are three variations to slurpy array parameters.\n\n  * The single asterisk form flattens passed arguments.\n\n  * The double asterisk form does not flatten arguments.\n\n  * The plus form flattens according to the single argument rule.\n\nEach will be described in detail in the next few sections. As the\ndifference between each is a bit nuanced, examples are provided for each to\ndemonstrate how each slurpy convention varies from the others.\n\n    Flattened slurpy\n\nSlurpy parameters declared with one asterisk will flatten arguments by\ndissolving one or more layers of bare Iterables.\n\n    my @array = <a b c>;\n    my $list := <d e f>;\n    sub a(*@a)  { @a.perl.say };\n    a(@array);                 # OUTPUT: «[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]»\n    a(1, $list, [2, 3]);       # OUTPUT: «[1, \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", 2, 3]»\n    a([1, 2]);                 # OUTPUT: «[1, 2]»\n    a(1, [1, 2], ([3, 4], 5)); # OUTPUT: «[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]»\n    a(($_ for 1, 2, 3));       # OUTPUT: «[1, 2, 3]»\n\n\nA single asterisk slurpy flattens all given iterables, effectively hoisting\nany object created with commas up to the top level.\n\n    Unflattened slurpy\n\nSlurpy parameters declared with two stars do not flatten any Iterable\narguments within the list, but keep the arguments more or less as-is:\n\n    my @array = <a b c>;\n    my $list := <d e f>;\n    sub b(**@b) { @b.perl.say };\n    b(@array);                 # OUTPUT: «[[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],]␤»\n    b(1, $list, [2, 3]);       # OUTPUT: «[1, (\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"), [2, 3]]␤»\n    b([1, 2]);                 # OUTPUT: «[[1, 2],]␤»\n    b(1, [1, 2], ([3, 4], 5)); # OUTPUT: «[1, [1, 2], ([3, 4], 5)]␤»\n    b(($_ for 1, 2, 3));       # OUTPUT: «[(1, 2, 3),]␤»\n\n\nThe double asterisk slurpy hides the nested comma objects and leaves them\nas-is in the slurpy array.\n\n    Single argument rule slurpy\n\nA slurpy parameter created using a plus engages the \"single argument rule\",\nwhich decides how to handle the slurpy argument based upon context.\nBasically, if only a single argument is passed and that argument is\nIterable, that argument is used to fill the slurpy parameter array. In any\nother case, +@ works like **@.\n\n    my @array = <a b c>;\n    my $list := <d e f>;\n    sub c(+@b) { @b.perl.say };\n    c(@array);                 # OUTPUT: «[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]␤»\n    c(1, $list, [2, 3]);       # OUTPUT: «[1, (\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"), [2, 3]]␤»\n    c([1, 2]);                 # OUTPUT: «[1, 2]␤»\n    c(1, [1, 2], ([3, 4], 5)); # OUTPUT: «[1, [1, 2], ([3, 4], 5)]␤»\n    c(($_ for 1, 2, 3));       # OUTPUT: «[1, 2, 3]␤»\n\n\nFor additional discussion and examples, see Slurpy Conventions for\nFunctions.\n\n  Type captures\n\nType captures allow deferring the specification of a type constraint to the\ntime the function is called. They allow referring to a type both in the\nsignature and the function body.\n\n    sub f(::T $p1, T $p2, ::C){\n        # $p1 and $p2 are of the same type T, that we don't know yet\n        # C will hold a type we derive from a type object or value\n        my C $division = $p1 / $p2;\n        return sub (T $p1) {\n            $division * $p1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The first parameter is Int and so must be the 2nd.\n    # We derive the 3rd type from calling the operator that is used in &f.\n    my &s = f(10, 2, Int.new / Int.new);\n    say s(2); # 10 / 2 * 2 == 10\n\n \n\n  Positional vs. named arguments\n\nAn argument can be positional or named. By default, arguments are\npositional, except slurpy hash and arguments marked with a leading colon :.\nThe latter is called a colon-pair. Check the following signatures and what\nthey denote:\n\n    $ = :($a);               # a positional argument\n    $ = :(:$a);              # a named argument of name 'a'\n    $ = :(*@a);              # a slurpy positional argument\n    $ = :(*%h);              # a slurpy named argument\n\nOn the caller side, positional arguments are passed in the same order as\nthe arguments are declared.\n\n    sub pos($x, $y) { \"x=$x y=$y\" }\n    pos(4, 5);                          # OUTPUT: «x=4 y=5»\n\nIn the case of named arguments and parameters, only the name is used for\nmapping arguments to parameters. If a fat arrow is used to construct a Pair\nonly those with valid identifiers as keys are recognized as named\narguments.\n\n    sub named(:$x, :$y) { \"x=$x y=$y\" }\n    named( y => 5, x => 4);             # OUTPUT: «x=4 y=5»\n\n\nYou can invoke the routine using a variable with the same name as the named\nargument; in that case : will be used for the invocation so that the name\nof the variable is understood as the key of the argument.\n\n    sub named-shortcut( :$shortcut ) {\n        say \"Looks like $shortcut\"\n    }\n    named-shortcut( shortcut => \"to here\"); # OUTPUT: «Looks like to here␤»\n    my $shortcut = \"Þor is mighty\";\n    named-shortcut( :$shortcut );           # OUTPUT: «Looks like Þor is mighty␤»\n\nIt is possible to have a different name for a named argument than the\nvariable name:\n\n    sub named(:official($private)) { \"Official business!\" if $private }\n    named :official;\n\n  Argument aliases\n\nThe colon-pair syntax can be used to provide aliases for arguments:\n\n    sub alias-named(:color(:$colour), :type(:class($kind))) {\n        say $colour ~ \" \" ~ $kind\n    }\n    alias-named(color => \"red\", type => \"A\");    # both names can be used\n    alias-named(colour => \"green\", type => \"B\"); # more than two names are ok\n    alias-named(color => \"white\", class => \"C\"); # every alias is independent\n\nThe presence of the colon : will decide whether we are creating a new named\nargument or not. :$colour will not only be the name of the aliased\nvariable, but also a new named argument (used in the second invocation).\nHowever, $kind will just be the name of the aliased variable, that does not\ncreate a new named argument. More uses of aliases can be found in sub\nMAIN.\n\nA function with named arguments can be called dynamically, dereferencing a\nPair with | to turn it into a named argument.\n\n    multi f(:$named) { note &?ROUTINE.signature };\n    multi f(:$also-named) { note &?ROUTINE.signature };\n    for 'named', 'also-named' -> $n {\n        f(|($n => rand))                # OUTPUT: «(:$named)␤(:$also-named)␤»\n    }\n\n    my $pair = :named(1);\n    f |$pair;                           # OUTPUT: «(:$named)␤»\n\nThe same can be used to convert a Hash into named arguments.\n\n    sub f(:$also-named) { note &?ROUTINE.signature };\n    my %pairs = also-named => 4;\n    f |%pairs;                              # OUTPUT: «(:$also-named)␤»\n\nA Hash that contains a list may prove problematic when slipped into named\narguments. To avoid the extra layer of containers coerce to Map before\nslipping.\n\n    class C { has $.x; has $.y; has @.z };\n    my %h = <x y z> Z=> (5, 20, [1,2]);\n    say C.new(|%h.Map);\n    # OUTPUT: «C.new(x => 5, y => 20, z => [1, 2])␤»\n\nYou can create as many aliases to a named argument as you want:\n\n    sub alias-named(:color(:$colour),\n                    :variety(:style(:sort(:type(:class($kind)))))) {\n        return $colour ~ \" \" ~ $kind\n    }\n    say alias-named(color => \"red\", style => \"A\");\n    say alias-named(colour => \"green\", variety => \"B\");\n    say alias-named(color => \"white\", class => \"C\");\n\n\n  Optional and mandatory arguments\n\nPositional parameters are mandatory by default, and can be made optional\nwith a default value or a trailing question mark:\n\n    $ = :(Str $id);         # required parameter\n    $ = :($base = 10);      # optional parameter, default value 10\n    $ = :(Int $x?);         # optional parameter, default is the Int type object\n\n Named parameters are optional by default, and can be made mandatory with a\ntrailing exclamation mark:\n\n    $ = :(:%config);        # optional parameter\n    $ = :(:$debug = False); # optional parameter, defaults to False\n    $ = :(:$name!);         # mandatory 'name' named parameter\n\nDefault values can depend on previous parameters, and are (at least\nnotionally) computed anew for each call\n\n    $ = :($goal, $accuracy = $goal / 100);\n    $ = :(:$excludes = ['.', '..']);        # a new Array for every call\n\n  Dynamic variables\n\nDynamic variables are allowed in signatures although they don't provide\nspecial behavior because argument binding does connect two scopes anyway.\n\n  Destructuring arguments\n\nNon-scalar parameters can be followed or substituted by a sub-signature in\nparentheses, which will destructure the argument given. The destructuring\nof a list is just its elements:\n\n    sub first(@array ($first, *@rest)) { $first }\n\nor\n\n    sub first([$f, *@]) { $f }\n\nWhile the destructuring of a hash is its pairs:\n\n    sub all-dimensions(% (:length(:$x), :width(:$y), :depth(:$z))) {\n        $x andthen $y andthen $z andthen True\n    }\n\nPointy loops can also destructure hashes, allowing assignment to\nvariables:\n\n    my %hhgttu = (:40life, :41universe, :42everything);\n    for %hhgttu -> (:$key, :$value) {\n      say \"$key → $value\";\n    }\n    # OUTPUT: «universe → 41␤life → 40␤everything → 42␤»\n\nIn general, an object is destructured based on its attributes. A common\nidiom is to unpack a Pair's key and value in a for loop:\n\n    for <Peter Paul Merry>.pairs -> (:key($index), :value($guest)) { }\n\nHowever, this unpacking of objects as their attributes is only the default\nbehavior. To make an object get destructured differently, change its\nCapture method.\n\n  Sub-signatures\n\nTo match against a compound parameter use a sub-signature following the\nargument name in parentheses.\n\n    sub foo(|c(Int, Str)){\n       put \"called with {c.perl}\"\n    };\n    foo(42, \"answer\");\n    # OUTPUT: «called with \\(42, \"answer\")␤»\n\n  Long names\n\nTo exclude certain parameters from being considered in multiple dispatch,\nseparate them with a double semicolon.\n\n    multi sub f(Int $i, Str $s;; :$b) { say \"$i, $s, {$b.perl}\" };\n    f(10, 'answer');\n    # OUTPUT: «10, answer, Any␤»\n\n  Capture parameters\n\nPrefixing a parameter with a vertical bar | makes the parameter a Capture,\nusing up all the remaining positional and named arguments.\n\nThis is often used in proto definitions (like proto foo (|) {*}) to\nindicate that the routine's multi definitions can have any type\nconstraints. See proto for an example.\n\nIf bound to a variable arguments can be forwarded as a whole using the slip\noperator |.\n\n    sub a(Int $i, Str $s) { say $i.^name ~ ' ' ~ $s.^name }\n    sub b(|c) { say c.^name; a(|c) }\n    b(42, \"answer\");\n    # OUTPUT: «Capture␤Int Str␤»\n\n  Parameter traits and modifiers\n\nBy default, parameters are bound to their argument and marked as read-only.\nOne can change that with traits on the parameter.\n\n The is copy trait causes the argument to be copied, and allows it to be\nmodified inside the routine\n\n    sub count-up($x is copy) {\n        $x = ∞ if $x ~~ Whatever;\n        .say for 1..$x;\n    }\n\n The is rw trait, which stands for is read-write, makes the parameter bind\nto a variable (or other writable container). Assigning to the parameter\nchanges the value of the variable at the caller side.\n\n    sub swap($x is rw, $y is rw) {\n        ($x, $y) = ($y, $x);\n    }\n\nOn slurpy parameters, is rw is reserved for future use by language\ndesigners.\n\n The is raw trait is automatically applied to parameters declared with a\nbackslash as a \"sigil\", and may also be used to make normally sigiled\nparameters behave like these do. In the special case of slurpies, which\nnormally produce an Array full of Scalars as described above, is raw will\ninstead cause the parameter to produce a List. Each element of that list\nwill be bound directly as raw parameter.\n\n To explicitly ask for a read-only parameter use the is readonly trait.\nPlease note that this applies only to the container. The object inside can\nvery well have mutator methods and Raku will not enforce immutability on\nthe attributes of the object.\n\nTraits can be followed by the where clause:\n\n    sub ip-expand-ipv6($ip is copy where m:i/^<[a..f\\d\\:]>**3..39$/) { }\n\n","t":"Signature","k":"c","a":[{"n":"@!params","t":"List","k":"v"},{"k":"v","t":"Mu","n":"$!returns"},{"k":"v","t":"int","n":"$!arity"},{"t":"Num","k":"v","n":"$!count"},{"t":"Code","k":"v","n":"$!code"}],"b":"A","n":"Signature","m":[{"s":{"p":["*%_"],"r":"Mu"},"n":"Capture","m":0,"d":"Defined as:\n\n    method Capture()\n\nThrows X::Cannot::Capture.\n\nRuntime creation of Signature objects (6.d, 2019.03 and later)\n\n    Signature.new(params => (...), returns => Type, arity => 1, count => 1)\n\n\nIn some situations, specifically when working with the MetaObject Protocol,\nit makes sense to create Signature objects programmatically.
