<h1>Jump between subs and methods</h1>
<p>
  Want to quickly get to the previous <code>sub</code> or <code>method</code>
  in the file you're editing?
</p>
<p>
  Save some keystrokes and use <span class="control">Alt+Up</span>
  and <span class="control">Alt+Down</span> to jump straight to the
  opening line of the next or previous major declaration.
</p>
<p>
  This also works for type declarations and attributes.
